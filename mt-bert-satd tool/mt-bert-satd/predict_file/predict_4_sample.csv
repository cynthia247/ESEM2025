"Expose individual interventional outcomes from RegressionEstimator _do operator (#1011) (#1018)

Explose individual interventional outcomes from RegressionEstimator _do operator.

Original implementation of _do for RegressionEstimators calculated individual outcomes for all dataframe rows, and then returned the mean(). However, for many use-cases it is helpful to have the individual outcomes for further analysis. This commit moves the existing implementation (without changes) to a new function interventional_outcomes() which returns all outcomes. The implementation of _do() now only calls mean() on the returned values. The behaviour of _do() is unchanged.

- In the ""early stopping"" method, the runs were converging slowly when a Shapley value is exactly zero, because the change was always considered as 100%. Now, if the Shapley value between two consecutive runs are exactly zero, then it is considered as 'converging'.

- Fix bug in early stopping where one can get negative percentages and, thus, the estimator would falsely stop too early.
- Early stopping criteria is now applied to the change of each Shapley value individually instead of the average change. This should ensure less variance in the results between two runs and more accurate results.
- Change minimum change in percentage threshold to 0.05 by default for early stopping. This balances out the potential slower runtime from the change above.

"Expose individual interventional outcomes from RegressionEstimator _do operator (#1011) (#1018)

Explose individual interventional outcomes from RegressionEstimator _do operator.

Original implementation of _do for RegressionEstimators calculated individual outcomes for all dataframe rows, and then returned the mean(). However, for many use-cases it is helpful to have the individual outcomes for further analysis. This commit moves the existing implementation (without changes) to a new function interventional_outcomes() which returns all outcomes. The implementation of _do() now only calls mean() on the returned values. The behaviour of _do() is unchanged.

- In the ""early stopping"" method, the runs were converging slowly when a Shapley value is exactly zero, because the change was always considered as 100%. Now, if the Shapley value between two consecutive runs are exactly zero, then it is considered as 'converging'.

- Using a quasi-random sequence generator now to improve uniform sampling of permutation. This should improve convergence (i.e., more accurate estimations)
- Fix bug in early stopping where one can get negative percentages and, thus, the estimator would falsely stop too early.
- Early stopping criteria is now applied to the change of each Shapley value individually instead of the average change. This should ensure less variance in the results between two runs and more accurate results.
- Change minimum change in percentage threshold to 0.05 by default for early stopping. This balances out the potential slower runtime from the change above.

Allow to call `effect`, `effect_inference`, and `shap_values` methods of wrapped EconML estimators by just passing in the whole dataframe, like you can with built-in estimators.

"Proposal: Finalize functional API refactor - deprecate causal graph (#943)

* Deprecate CausalGraph

The effect estimation API is now based on an functional API that expects a networkx graph as input.

- The graph should now be defined via a networkx graph. Most identification methods now expect an additional ""observed_nodes"" parameter accordingly.
- CausalModel and CausalGraph still exist and should be compatible with the old API.

This module adds a new method for evaluating a fitted gcm.

This further adds a new user guide and notebook entries demonstrating the usage.

"Expose individual interventional outcomes from RegressionEstimator _do operator (#1011) (#1018)

Explose individual interventional outcomes from RegressionEstimator _do operator.

Original implementation of _do for RegressionEstimators calculated individual outcomes for all dataframe rows, and then returned the mean(). However, for many use-cases it is helpful to have the individual outcomes for further analysis. This commit moves the existing implementation (without changes) to a new function interventional_outcomes() which returns all outcomes. The implementation of _do() now only calls mean() on the returned values. The behaviour of _do() is unchanged.

"Add method to estimate ICC for single samples

Before, it was only possible to estimate intrinsic causal contributions with respect to the distribution.

"Revise early stopping convergence critera for Shapley value estimator

- In the ""early stopping"" method, the runs were converging slowly when a Shapley value is exactly zero, because the change was always considered as 100%. Now, if the Shapley value between two consecutive runs are exactly zero, then it is considered as 'converging'.
- Since the Shapley estimator supports the estimation of multiple vectors of Shapley values at the same time, this change also introduces some logic to keep track of the convergence for each vector individually.

"Revise gcm arrow strength

Signed-off-by: Patrick Bloebaum <bloebp@amazon.com>",0
"Revise gcm Shapley estimator

- Shapley config parameter now clearly distinguishes between num_subset_sampling and num_permutations
- Using a quasi-random sequence generator now to improve uniform sampling of permutation. This should improve convergence (i.e., more accurate estimations)
- Fix bug in early stopping where one can get negative percentages and, thus, the estimator would falsely stop too early.
- Early stopping criteria is now applied to the change of each Shapley value individually instead of the average change. This should ensure less variance in the results between two runs and more accurate results.
- Change minimum change in percentage threshold to 0.05 by default for early stopping. This balances out the potential slower runtime from the change above.

"Change one-hot-encoding behaviour in gcm module

Before, one dimension is dropped in the encoding.

"remove basic logging configuration (#231)

When `basicConfig` is called, logging is set up automatically and unless
a `logging.NullHandler` instance is included with each call it becomes
very difficult to control logging from DoWhy. This change removes all
calls to `basicConfig` and adds a `NullHandler` to the root DoWhy
logger. Now, users of DoWhy can configure their logging preference
through something like `logging.config.dictConfig` with a reference to
`dowhy` in the `loggers` section of the configuration.

"Expose individual interventional outcomes from RegressionEstimator _do operator (#1011) (#1018)

Explose individual interventional outcomes from RegressionEstimator _do operator.

Original implementation of _do for RegressionEstimators calculated individual outcomes for all dataframe rows, and then returned the mean(). However, for many use-cases it is helpful to have the individual outcomes for further analysis. This commit moves the existing implementation (without changes) to a new function interventional_outcomes() which returns all outcomes. The implementation of _do() now only calls mean() on the returned values. The behaviour of _do() is unchanged.

"Revise early stopping convergence critera for Shapley value estimator

- In the ""early stopping"" method, the runs were converging slowly when a Shapley value is exactly zero, because the change was always considered as 100%. Now, if the Shapley value between two consecutive runs are exactly zero, then it is considered as 'converging'.
- Since the Shapley estimator supports the estimation of multiple vectors of Shapley values at the same time, this change also introduces some logic to keep track of the convergence for each vector individually.

"Revise gcm Shapley estimator

- Shapley config parameter now clearly distinguishes between num_subset_sampling and num_permutations
- Using a quasi-random sequence generator now to improve uniform sampling of permutation. This should improve convergence (i.e., more accurate estimations)
- Fix bug in early stopping where one can get negative percentages and, thus, the estimator would falsely stop too early.
- Early stopping criteria is now applied to the change of each Shapley value individually instead of the average change. This should ensure less variance in the results between two runs and more accurate results.
- Change minimum change in percentage threshold to 0.05 by default for early stopping. This balances out the potential slower runtime from the change above.

* fix: added `include_unobserved` parameter to `identify_backdoor` to be explicit about unobserved variables.

* feat: added minimum-sufficient and maximum-possible methods to identify-backdoor
fix: default backdoor set now contains minimum possible number of instrumental variables;
mod: temporarily made include_unobserved to be True by the default, as most tests require it.

* mod: changed backdoor method names: `minimum-sufficient` to `minimal-adjustment` and `maxumum-possible` to `maximal-adjustment`

* mod: adding tests for minimal and maximal adjustment, whether adjustment is necessary and small refactoring

* fix: fix a bug with some maximal adjustment not existing because it contained unobserved variables. This also brings some performance improvements when there is a lot of unobserved variables.",0

"remove basic logging configuration (#231)

When `basicConfig` is called, logging is set up automatically and unless
a `logging.NullHandler` instance is included with each call it becomes
very difficult to control logging from DoWhy. This change removes all
calls to `basicConfig` and adds a `NullHandler` to the root DoWhy
logger. Now, users of DoWhy can configure their logging preference
through something like `logging.config.dictConfig` with a reference to
`dowhy` in the `loggers` section of the configuration.

"Revise early stopping convergence critera for Shapley value estimator

- In the ""early stopping"" method, the runs were converging slowly when a Shapley value is exactly zero, because the change was always considered as 100%. Now, if the Shapley value between two consecutive runs are exactly zero, then it is considered as 'converging'.
- Since the Shapley estimator supports the estimation of multiple vectors of Shapley values at the same time, this change also introduces some logic to keep track of the convergence for each vector individually.

"Revise gcm Shapley estimator

- Shapley config parameter now clearly distinguishes between num_subset_sampling and num_permutations
- Using a quasi-random sequence generator now to improve uniform sampling of permutation. This should improve convergence (i.e., more accurate estimations)
- Fix bug in early stopping where one can get negative percentages and, thus, the estimator would falsely stop too early.
- Early stopping criteria is now applied to the change of each Shapley value individually instead of the average change. This should ensure less variance in the results between two runs and more accurate results.
- Change minimum change in percentage threshold to 0.05 by default for early stopping. This balances out the potential slower runtime from the change above.

* fix: added `include_unobserved` parameter to `identify_backdoor` to be explicit about unobserved variables.

* feat: added minimum-sufficient and maximum-possible methods to identify-backdoor
fix: default backdoor set now contains minimum possible number of instrumental variables;
mod: temporarily made include_unobserved to be True by the default, as most tests require it.

* mod: changed backdoor method names: `minimum-sufficient` to `minimal-adjustment` and `maxumum-possible` to `maximal-adjustment`

* mod: adding tests for minimal and maximal adjustment, whether adjustment is necessary and small refactoring

* fix: fix a bug with some maximal adjustment not existing because it contained unobserved variables. This also brings some performance improvements when there is a lot of unobserved variables.",0

"remove basic logging configuration (#231)

When `basicConfig` is called, logging is set up automatically and unless
a `logging.NullHandler` instance is included with each call it becomes
very difficult to control logging from DoWhy. This change removes all
calls to `basicConfig` and adds a `NullHandler` to the root DoWhy
logger. Now, users of DoWhy can configure their logging preference
through something like `logging.config.dictConfig` with a reference to
`dowhy` in the `loggers` section of the configuration.

"Support for when effect modifiers and common causes include common variables and compatibility with econml (#139)

* Effect modifiers can be common causes too. When that occurs, graph shows them as a common cause but they are separately recorded as an effect_modifier too.

"Enhancing dummy outcome refuter with ML functions (#136)

* A strategy similar to t-learner to create functions of w that estimate y, and are independent of T.
* We create an estimator for t=t_i and then find the value for the other values of t_i. This allows us to isolate the causal effect of t from y during the optimization process.

fix: default backdoor set now contains minimum possible number of instrumental variables;

"remove basic logging configuration (#231)

When `basicConfig` is called, logging is set up automatically and unless

logger. Now, users of DoWhy can configure their logging preference

* fix: added `include_unobserved` parameter to `identify_backdoor` to be explicit about unobserved variables.

* feat: added minimum-sufficient and maximum-possible methods to identify-backdoor
fix: default backdoor set now contains minimum possible number of instrumental variables;
mod: temporarily made include_unobserved to be True by the default, as most tests require it.

* mod: changed backdoor method names: `minimum-sufficient` to `minimal-adjustment` and `maxumum-possible` to `maximal-adjustment`

* mod: adding tests for minimal and maximal adjustment, whether adjustment is necessary and small refactoring

* fix: fix a bug with some maximal adjustment not existing because it contained unobserved variables. This also brings some performance improvements when there is a lot of unobserved variables.",0

"remove basic logging configuration (#231)

When `basicConfig` is called, logging is set up automatically and unless
a `logging.NullHandler` instance is included with each call it becomes
very difficult to control logging from DoWhy. This change removes all
calls to `basicConfig` and adds a `NullHandler` to the root DoWhy
logger. Now, users of DoWhy can configure their logging preference
through something like `logging.config.dictConfig` with a reference to
`dowhy` in the `loggers` section of the configuration.

Version Bump: v0.7 (#355),0
"Changed default identification behavior with unobserved variables (#354)

Earlier, DoWhy would automatically add an unobserved variable, but it created confusion.

New behavior:
DoWhy does not add an unobserved variable. User has to provide it.
Identification proceeds as per user-provided graph. Simplified code.

* proceed_when_unidentifiable is redundant. Will be removed in a future version.

* fixed some identification errors with unobserved variables

PS Stratification needed users to specify both num_strata and clipping_threshold. This PR adds an iterative method to select num_strata automatically given a clipping_threshold. The thumb rule is that the chosen num_strata should lead to at least half of the strata having at least clipping_threshold data points for both treatment and control.

* fix: added `include_unobserved` parameter to `identify_backdoor` to be explicit about unobserved variables.

* feat: added minimum-sufficient and maximum-possible methods to identify-backdoor
fix: default backdoor set now contains minimum possible number of instrumental variables;
mod: temporarily made include_unobserved to be True by the default, as most tests require it.

* mod: changed backdoor method names: `minimum-sufficient` to `minimal-adjustment` and `maxumum-possible` to `maximal-adjustment`

* mod: adding tests for minimal and maximal adjustment, whether adjustment is necessary and small refactoring

* fix: fix a bug with some maximal adjustment not existing because it contained unobserved variables. This also brings some performance improvements when there is a lot of unobserved variables.",0

"remove basic logging configuration (#231)

When `basicConfig` is called, logging is set up automatically and unless

very difficult to control logging from DoWhy. This change removes all

logger. Now, users of DoWhy can configure their logging preference
through something like `logging.config.dictConfig` with a reference to
`dowhy` in the `loggers` section of the configuration.

"remove basic logging configuration (#231)

When `basicConfig` is called, logging is set up automatically and unless
a `logging.NullHandler` instance is included with each call it becomes
very difficult to control logging from DoWhy. This change removes all
calls to `basicConfig` and adds a `NullHandler` to the root DoWhy
logger. Now, users of DoWhy can configure their logging preference
through something like `logging.config.dictConfig` with a reference to
`dowhy` in the `loggers` section of the configuration.

"Support for when effect modifiers and common causes include common variables and compatibility with econml (#139)

* Effect modifiers can be common causes too. When that occurs, graph shows them as a common cause but they are separately recorded as an effect_modifier too.

"Enhancing dummy outcome refuter with ML functions (#136)

* A strategy similar to t-learner to create functions of w that estimate y, and are independent of T.
* We create an estimator for t=t_i and then find the value for the other values of t_i. This allows us to isolate the causal effect of t from y during the optimization process.

Permit passing of number of simulations using the method_params parameter (useful because the default 1000 simulations for propensity score matching can take several minutes and because test_significance is not usually called manually).",0

"Bumping up version number and updating docs in prep for release (#143)

* added cate estimator to causal estimator and one specific estiamtor for linear regression

"Support for when effect modifiers and common causes include common variables and compatibility with econml (#139)

* Effect modifiers can be common causes too. When that occurs, graph shows them as a common cause but they are separately recorded as an effect_modifier too.

"Changed string from of causal estimator when p=0.0 so instead it prints p< (1/number of simulations). Might consider writing an attribute of CausalEstimator to output the p value so this is done in all circumstances.

Changed a line in test_significance that threw an exception when the estimated value was lower than the median estimate of the simulations.

Permit passing of number of simulations using the method_params parameter (useful because the default 1000 simulations for propensity score matching can take several minutes and because test_significance is not usually called manually).",0
