See\nhttps://gitlab.com/tensors/tensor_toolbox/blob/master/cp_als.m and\nhttps://gitlab.com/tensors/tensor_toolbox/blob/master/@ktensor/norm.m.\n\nThe norm computed here is not numerically identical to the norm as previously\ncomputed, due to numerical differences.\n\nThis still requires cleanup to continue to work with non-sparse arrays (I\nhaven't factored out sparse.stack to the backend yet).",
