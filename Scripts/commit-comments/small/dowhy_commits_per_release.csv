v0.12,"Expose individual interventional outcomes from RegressionEstimator _do operator (#1011) (#1018)

Explose individual interventional outcomes from RegressionEstimator _do operator.

Original implementation of _do for RegressionEstimators calculated individual outcomes for all dataframe rows, and then returned the mean(). However, for many use-cases it is helpful to have the individual outcomes for further analysis. This commit moves the existing implementation (without changes) to a new function interventional_outcomes() which returns all outcomes. The implementation of _do() now only calls mean() on the returned values. The behaviour of _do() is unchanged.

v0.12,"Revise early stopping convergence critera for Shapley value estimator

- In the ""early stopping"" method, the runs were converging slowly when a Shapley value is exactly zero, because the change was always considered as 100%. Now, if the Shapley value between two consecutive runs are exactly zero, then it is considered as 'converging'.
- Since the Shapley estimator supports the estimation of multiple vectors of Shapley values at the same time, this change also introduces some logic to keep track of the convergence for each vector individually.

v0.12,"Revise gcm Shapley estimator

- Shapley config parameter now clearly distinguishes between num_subset_sampling and num_permutations
- Using a quasi-random sequence generator now to improve uniform sampling of permutation. This should improve convergence (i.e., more accurate estimations)
- Fix bug in early stopping where one can get negative percentages and, thus, the estimator would falsely stop too early.
- Early stopping criteria is now applied to the change of each Shapley value individually instead of the average change. This should ensure less variance in the results between two runs and more accurate results.
- Change minimum change in percentage threshold to 0.05 by default for early stopping. This balances out the potential slower runtime from the change above.

However, for many use-cases it is helpful to have the individual outcomes for further analysis. This commit moves the existing implementation (without changes) to a new function interventional_outcomes() which returns all outcomes. The implementation of _do() now only calls mean() on the returned values. The behaviour of _do() is unchanged.

Furthermore log additional information to logger level

v0.11.1,"Changed string from of causal estimator when p=0.0 so instead it prints p< (1/number of simulations). Might consider writing an attribute of CausalEstimator to output the p value so this is done in all circumstances.

Changed a line in test_significance that threw an exception when the estimated value was lower than the median estimate of the simulations.

Permit passing of number of simulations using the method_params parameter (useful because the default 1000 simulations for propensity score matching can take several minutes and because test_significance is not usually called manually)."

However, for many use-cases it is helpful to have the individual outcomes for further analysis. This commit moves the existing implementation (without changes) to a new function interventional_outcomes() which returns all outcomes. The implementation of _do() now only calls mean() on the returned values. The behaviour of _do() is unchanged.

* fix: added `include_unobserved` parameter to `identify_backdoor` to be explicit about unobserved variables.

* feat: added minimum-sufficient and maximum-possible methods to identify-backdoor
fix: default backdoor set now contains minimum possible number of instrumental variables;
mod: temporarily made include_unobserved to be True by the default, as most tests require it.

* mod: changed backdoor method names: `minimum-sufficient` to `minimal-adjustment` and `maxumum-possible` to `maximal-adjustment`

* mod: adding tests for minimal and maximal adjustment, whether adjustment is necessary and small refactoring

* fix: fix a bug with some maximal adjustment not existing because it contained unobserved variables. This also brings some performance improvements when there is a lot of unobserved variables."

v0.10.1,"Expose individual interventional outcomes from RegressionEstimator _do operator (#1011) (#1018)

Explose individual interventional outcomes from RegressionEstimator _do operator.

Original implementation of _do for RegressionEstimators calculated individual outcomes for all dataframe rows, and then returned the mean(). However, for many use-cases it is helpful to have the individual outcomes for further analysis. This commit moves the existing implementation (without changes) to a new function interventional_outcomes() which returns all outcomes. The implementation of _do() now only calls mean() on the returned values. The behaviour of _do() is unchanged.

v0.10,"Revise gcm Shapley estimator

- Shapley config parameter now clearly distinguishes between num_subset_sampling and num_permutations
- Using a quasi-random sequence generator now to improve uniform sampling of permutation. This should improve convergence (i.e., more accurate estimations)
- Fix bug in early stopping where one can get negative percentages and, thus, the estimator would falsely stop too early.
- Early stopping criteria is now applied to the change of each Shapley value individually instead of the average change. This should ensure less variance in the results between two runs and more accurate results.
- Change minimum change in percentage threshold to 0.05 by default for early stopping. This balances out the potential slower runtime from the change above.

v0.1-alpha,"Changed string from of causal estimator when p=0.0 so instead it prints p< (1/number of simulations). Might consider writing an attribute of CausalEstimator to output the p value so this is done in all circumstances.

Changed a line in test_significance that threw an exception when the estimated value was lower than the median estimate of the simulations.

Permit passing of number of simulations using the method_params parameter (useful because the default 1000 simulations for propensity score matching can take several minutes and because test_significance is not usually called manually)."
