Additional Unit Tests for Limone

@michaellevy I didn't know how long my github account would be associated with Health Catalyst and I figured it would be good practice to start working in the forked repo. That being said, it's kind of silly to make you merge my two branches while I still have control over both, so I'll go ahead and do that.

My only hesitation in adding this to master is that one of the unit tests sporadically fails (maybe 10% of the time) on my machine (related to #659), so it my be a good idea to deal with that issue first. I'll add a comment about this in the other pull request."

Additional Unit Tests for Limone

@michaellevy I didn't know how long my github account would be associated with Health Catalyst and I figured it would be good practice to start working in the forked repo. That being said, it's kind of silly to make you merge my two branches while I still have control over both, so I'll go ahead and do that.

My only hesitation in adding this to master is that one of the unit tests sporadically fails (maybe 10% of the time) on my machine (related to #659), so it my be a good idea to deal with that issue first. I'll add a comment about this in the other pull request."

Additional Unit Tests for Limone

@michaellevy I didn't know how long my github account would be associated with Health Catalyst and I figured it would be good practice to start working in the forked repo. That being said, it's kind of silly to make you merge my two branches while I still have control over both, so I'll go ahead and do that.

My only hesitation in adding this to master is that one of the unit tests sporadically fails (maybe 10% of the time) on my machine (related to #659), so it my be a good idea to deal with that issue first. I'll add a comment about this in the other pull request."

Additional Unit Tests for Limone

@michaellevy I didn't know how long my github account would be associated with Health Catalyst and I figured it would be good practice to start working in the forked repo. That being said, it's kind of silly to make you merge my two branches while I still have control over both, so I'll go ahead and do that.

My only hesitation in adding this to master is that one of the unit tests sporadically fails (maybe 10% of the time) on my machine (related to #659), so it my be a good idea to deal with that issue first. I'll add a comment about this in the other pull request."

Additional Unit Tests for Limone

@michaellevy I didn't know how long my github account would be associated with Health Catalyst and I figured it would be good practice to start working in the forked repo. That being said, it's kind of silly to make you merge my two branches while I still have control over both, so I'll go ahead and do that.

My only hesitation in adding this to master is that one of the unit tests sporadically fails (maybe 10% of the time) on my machine (related to #659), so it my be a good idea to deal with that issue first. I'll add a comment about this in the other pull request."

Additional Unit Tests for Limone

@michaellevy I didn't know how long my github account would be associated with Health Catalyst and I figured it would be good practice to start working in the forked repo. That being said, it's kind of silly to make you merge my two branches while I still have control over both, so I'll go ahead and do that.

My only hesitation in adding this to master is that one of the unit tests sporadically fails (maybe 10% of the time) on my machine (related to #659), so it my be a good idea to deal with that issue first. I'll add a comment about this in the other pull request."

Additional Unit Tests for Limone

@michaellevy I didn't know how long my github account would be associated with Health Catalyst and I figured it would be good practice to start working in the forked repo. That being said, it's kind of silly to make you merge my two branches while I still have control over both, so I'll go ahead and do that.

My only hesitation in adding this to master is that one of the unit tests sporadically fails (maybe 10% of the time) on my machine (related to #659), so it my be a good idea to deal with that issue first. I'll add a comment about this in the other pull request."

Additional Unit Tests for Limone

@michaellevy I didn't know how long my github account would be associated with Health Catalyst and I figured it would be good practice to start working in the forked repo. That being said, it's kind of silly to make you merge my two branches while I still have control over both, so I'll go ahead and do that.

My only hesitation in adding this to master is that one of the unit tests sporadically fails (maybe 10% of the time) on my machine (related to #659), so it my be a good idea to deal with that issue first. I'll add a comment about this in the other pull request."

Additional Unit Tests for Limone

@michaellevy I didn't know how long my github account would be associated with Health Catalyst and I figured it would be good practice to start working in the forked repo. That being said, it's kind of silly to make you merge my two branches while I still have control over both, so I'll go ahead and do that.

My only hesitation in adding this to master is that one of the unit tests sporadically fails (maybe 10% of the time) on my machine (related to #659), so it my be a good idea to deal with that issue first. I'll add a comment about this in the other pull request."

Additional Unit Tests for Limone

@michaellevy I didn't know how long my github account would be associated with Health Catalyst and I figured it would be good practice to start working in the forked repo. That being said, it's kind of silly to make you merge my two branches while I still have control over both, so I'll go ahead and do that.

My only hesitation in adding this to master is that one of the unit tests sporadically fails (maybe 10% of the time) on my machine (related to #659), so it my be a good idea to deal with that issue first. I'll add a comment about this in the other pull request."

@michaellevy I didn't know how long my github account would be associated with Health Catalyst and I figured it would be good practice to start working in the forked repo. That being said, it's kind of silly to make you merge my two branches while I still have control over both, so I'll go ahead and do that.

My only hesitation in adding this to master is that one of the unit tests sporadically fails (maybe 10% of the time) on my machine (related to #659), so it my be a good idea to deal with that issue first. I'll add a comment about this in the other pull request."

2 problems can occur when assigning labels based on max row labels.
- If a single group gets split into 2 clusters, the confusion matrix ends up with 2 `1s` in a column. Throws a warning and doesn't name clusters.
- If a cluster boundary perfectly splits a known group, you'll end up with duplicates in a row. Throws a warning and doesn't name clusters."

Additional Unit Tests for Limone

@michaellevy I didn't know how long my github account would be associated with Health Catalyst and I figured it would be good practice to start working in the forked repo. That being said, it's kind of silly to make you merge my two branches while I still have control over both, so I'll go ahead and do that.

My only hesitation in adding this to master is that one of the unit tests sporadically fails (maybe 10% of the time) on my machine (related to #659), so it my be a good idea to deal with that issue first. I'll add a comment about this in the other pull request."

Additional Unit Tests for Limone

@michaellevy I didn't know how long my github account would be associated with Health Catalyst and I figured it would be good practice to start working in the forked repo. That being said, it's kind of silly to make you merge my two branches while I still have control over both, so I'll go ahead and do that.

My only hesitation in adding this to master is that one of the unit tests sporadically fails (maybe 10% of the time) on my machine (related to #659), so it my be a good idea to deal with that issue first. I'll add a comment about this in the other pull request."

Additional Unit Tests for Limone

@michaellevy I didn't know how long my github account would be associated with Health Catalyst and I figured it would be good practice to start working in the forked repo. That being said, it's kind of silly to make you merge my two branches while I still have control over both, so I'll go ahead and do that.

My only hesitation in adding this to master is that one of the unit tests sporadically fails (maybe 10% of the time) on my machine (related to #659), so it my be a good idea to deal with that issue first. I'll add a comment about this in the other pull request."
