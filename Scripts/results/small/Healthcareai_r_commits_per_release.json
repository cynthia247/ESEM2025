That being said, it's kind of silly to make you merge my two branches while I still have control over both, so I'll go ahead and do that.\r\n\r\nMy only hesitation in adding this to master is that one of the unit tests sporadically fails (maybe 10% of the time) on my machine (related to #659), so it my be a good idea to deal with that issue first. I'll add a comment about this in the other pull request.",

        "Merge pull request #658 from yvanhuele/limone-unit-tests\n\nAdditional Unit Tests for Limone\r\n\r\n@michaellevy I didn't know how long my github account would be associated with Health Catalyst and I figured it would be good practice to start working in the forked repo. That being said, it's kind of silly to make you merge my two branches while I still have control over both, so I'll go ahead and do that.\r\n\r\nMy only hesitation in adding this to master is that one of the unit tests sporadically fails (maybe 10% of the time) on my machine (related to #659), so it my be a good idea to deal with that issue first. I'll add a comment about this in the other pull request.",

That being said, it's kind of silly to make you merge my two branches while I still have control over both, so I'll go ahead and do that.\r\n\r\nMy only hesitation in adding this to master is that one of the unit tests sporadically fails (maybe 10% of the time) on my machine (related to #659), so it my be a good idea to deal with that issue first. I'll add a comment about this in the other pull request.",

That being said, it's kind of silly to make you merge my two branches while I still have control over both, so I'll go ahead and do that.\r\n\r\nMy only hesitation in adding this to master is that one of the unit tests sporadically fails (maybe 10% of the time) on my machine (related to #659), so it my be a good idea to deal with that issue first.
