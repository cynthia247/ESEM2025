Observe the behavior of `binary` and `xentropy` objectives,0

The speed of `binary` is not drastically different than,0

"Note: in order to create exactly the same dataset with the one created in simple_example.py, we need",0
to modify simple_example.py to pass numpy array instead of pandas DataFrame to Dataset constructor.,0
The reason is that DataFrame column names will be used in Dataset. For a DataFrame with Int64Index,0
"as columns, Dataset will use column names like [""0"", ""1"", ""2"", ...]. While for numpy array, column names",0
"are using the default one assigned in C++ code (dataset_loader.cpp), like [""Column_0"", ""Column_1"", ...].",0
Y has a single column and we read it in single shot. So store it as an 1-d array.,0
We use random access for data sampling when creating LightGBM Dataset from Sequence.,0
"When accessing any element in a HDF5 chunk, it's read entirely.",0
"To save I/O for sampling, we should keep number of total chunks much larger than sample count.",0

The speed of `binary` is not drastically different than,0

"Note: in order to create exactly the same dataset with the one created in simple_example.py, we need",0
to modify simple_example.py to pass numpy array instead of pandas DataFrame to Dataset constructor.,0
The reason is that DataFrame column names will be used in Dataset. For a DataFrame with Int64Index,0
"as columns, Dataset will use column names like [""0"", ""1"", ""2"", ...]. While for numpy array, column names",0
"are using the default one assigned in C++ code (dataset_loader.cpp), like [""Column_0"", ""Column_1"", ...].",0
Y has a single column and we read it in single shot. So store it as an 1-d array.,0

"To save I/O for sampling, we should keep number of total chunks much larger than sample count.",0

Simulate some binary data with a single categorical and,0

################,0
Set up a couple of utilities for our experiments,0
################,0
Observe the behavior of `binary` and `xentropy` objectives,0
Trying this throws an error on non-binary values of y:,0
"experiment('binary', label_type='probability', DATA)",0
The speed of `binary` is not drastically different than,0
"`xentropy`. `xentropy` runs faster than `binary` in many cases, although",0
there are reasons to suspect that `binary` should run faster when the,0
label is an integer instead of a float,0

We can also open HDF5 file once and get access to,0
"With binary dataset created, we can use either Python API or cmdline version to train.",0
,0
"Note: in order to create exactly the same dataset with the one created in simple_example.py, we need",0
to modify simple_example.py to pass numpy array instead of pandas DataFrame to Dataset constructor.,0
The reason is that DataFrame column names will be used in Dataset. For a DataFrame with Int64Index,0
"as columns, Dataset will use column names like [""0"", ""1"", ""2"", ...]. While for numpy array, column names",0
"are using the default one assigned in C++ code (dataset_loader.cpp), like [""Column_0"", ""Column_1"", ...].",0
Y has a single column and we read it in single shot. So store it as an 1-d array.,0
We use random access for data sampling when creating LightGBM Dataset from Sequence.,0
"When accessing any element in a HDF5 chunk, it's read entirely.",0
"To save I/O for sampling, we should keep number of total chunks much larger than sample count.",0
Here we are just creating a chunk size that matches with batch_size.,0
,0
Also note that the data is stored in row major order to avoid extra copy when passing to,0
lightgbm Dataset.,0
Save to 2 HDF5 files for demonstration.,0
We can store multiple datasets inside a single HDF5 file.,0
Separating X and Y for choosing best chunk size for data loading.,0
split training data into two partitions,0
make this array dense because we're splitting across,0
a sparse boundary to partition the data,0

predictions and target values back from workers to the client,0

"Note: in order to create exactly the same dataset with the one created in simple_example.py, we need",0
to modify simple_example.py to pass numpy array instead of pandas DataFrame to Dataset constructor.,0
The reason is that DataFrame column names will be used in Dataset. For a DataFrame with Int64Index,0
"as columns, Dataset will use column names like [""0"", ""1"", ""2"", ...]. While for numpy array, column names",0
"are using the default one assigned in C++ code (dataset_loader.cpp), like [""Column_0"", ""Column_1"", ...].",0

"Note: in order to create exactly the same dataset with the one created in simple_example.py, we need",0
to modify simple_example.py to pass numpy array instead of pandas DataFrame to Dataset constructor.,0
The reason is that DataFrame column names will be used in Dataset. For a DataFrame with Int64Index,0
"as columns, Dataset will use column names like [""0"", ""1"", ""2"", ...]. While for numpy array, column names",0
"are using the default one assigned in C++ code (dataset_loader.cpp), like [""Column_0"", ""Column_1"", ...].",0
Y has a single column and we read it in single shot. So store it as an 1-d array.,0
We use random access for data sampling when creating LightGBM Dataset from Sequence.,0
"When accessing any element in a HDF5 chunk, it's read entirely.",0
"To save I/O for sampling, we should keep number of total chunks much larger than sample count.",0
Here we are just creating a chunk size that matches with batch_size.,0
,0
Also note that the data is stored in row major order to avoid extra copy when passing to,0
lightgbm Dataset.,0
Save to 2 HDF5 files for demonstration.,0
We can store multiple datasets inside a single HDF5 file.,0
Separating X and Y for choosing best chunk size for data loading.,0
split training data into two partitions,0
make this array dense because we're splitting across,0
