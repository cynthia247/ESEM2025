This example shows how to use the External Physics Engine,0
It allows you to control the drone through setVehiclePose and obtain collision information.,0
It is especially useful for injecting your own flight dynamics model to the AirSim drone.,0
Use Blocks environment to see the drone colliding and seeing the collision information,0
in the command prompt.,0
Add this line to your settings.json before running AirSim:,0

AirSim uses NED coordinates so negative axis is up.,0
z of -7 is 7 meters above the original launch point.,0
Fly given velocity vector for 5 seconds,0
using airsim.DrivetrainType.MaxDegreeOfFreedom means we can control the drone yaw independently,0
from the direction the drone is flying.  I've set values here that make the drone always point inwards,0
towards the inside of the box (which would be handy if you are building a 3d scan of an object in the real world).,0
Make the drone fly in a circle.,0
"center is just a direction vector, so normalize it to compute the actual cx,cy locations.",0

AirSim uses NED coordinates so negative axis is up.,0
ramp up time,0
ramp up to full speed in smooth increments so we don't start too aggressively.,0
compute current angle,0
compute lookahead,0
if we did the takeoff then also do the landing.,0
tracking # of completed orbits is surprisingly tricky to get right in order to handle random wobbles,0
about the starting point.  So we watch for complete 1/2 orbits to avoid that problem.,0
now we just have to watch for a smooth crossing from negative diff to positive diff,0
ignore the click over from 360 back to 0,0
watch direction this diff is moving if it switches from shrinking to growing,0
then we passed the starting point.,0
first hold our current position so drone doesn't try and keep flying while we take the picture.,0
AirSim uses NED coordinates so negative axis is up.,0
z of -5 is 5 meters above the original launch point.,0
see https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim/wiki/moveOnPath-demo,0
this method is async and we are not waiting for the result since we are passing timeout_sec=0.,0
drone will over-shoot so we bring it back to the start point before landing.,0
Run this script with clock speed in settings.json,0
"""ClockSpeed"": 1 then change it to 0.5",0

with ClockSpeed = 0.5 you will see that this takes 6s (system time) and not 3s,0

setup clock in ClockFactory,0
scalable clock returns interval same as wall clock but multiplied by a scale factor,0
steppable clock returns interval that is a constant number irrespective of wall clock,0
we can either multiply this fixed interval by scale factor to speed up/down the clock,0
but that would cause vehicles like quadrotors to become unstable,0
so alternative we use here is instead to scale control loop frequency. The downside is that,0
"depending on compute power available, we will max out control loop frequency and therefore can no longer",0
get increase in clock speed,0

scalable clock returns interval same as wall clock but multiplied by a scale factor,0
steppable clock returns interval that is a constant number irrespective of wall clock,0
we can either multiply this fixed interval by scale factor to speed up/down the clock,0
but that would cause vehicles like quadrotors to become unstable,0
so alternative we use here is instead to scale control loop frequency. The downside is that,0

thread has finished rendering the current and the subsequent frame. This means,0

this by telling the viewport to flush the rendering queue at the end of each,0
