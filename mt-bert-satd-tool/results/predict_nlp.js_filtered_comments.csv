RV as follow,0
"If the second letter is a consonant, RV is the region after the next following vowel",0
"or if the first two letters are vowels, RV is the region after the next consonant",0
otherwise (consonant-vowel case) RV is the region after the third letter. But RV is the end of the word if these positions cannot be found.,0

Determines R1 and R2; adapted from the French Porter Stemmer,0
"R1 is the region after the first non-vowel following a vowel,",0
Or is the null region at the end of the word if there is no such non-vowel.,0
R1 is adjusted such that the region before it contains at least 3 characters,0
R1 is not null,0
Region before does not contain at least 3 characters,0
Now R1 contains at least 3 characters,0
It is not possible to make the region before long enough,0

"If the second letter is a consonant, RV is the region after the next following vowel,",0
RV as follow,0
"If the second letter is a consonant, RV is the region after the next following vowel",0
"or if the first two letters are vowels, RV is the region after the next consonant",0
otherwise (consonant-vowel case) RV is the region after the third letter. But RV is the end of the word if these positions cannot be found.,0

Do step 2a if no ending was removed by step 1.,0
"Do Step 2b if step 2a was done, but failed to remove a suffix.",0
This is probably faster than an if at each iteration.,0
