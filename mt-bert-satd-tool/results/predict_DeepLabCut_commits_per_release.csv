"""deeplabcut.filterpredictions"" and ""deeplabcut.analyze_skeleton"" return mappings (#1908)

* REF: Denest filterpredictions for loop

there were two try/excepts, one within the other.
this commit simplifies the code by pulling the inner try/except out.

the code now tries to look for filtered data. if filtered data is found
for the video, we continue to the next item in the loop.

if not found, we catch and ignore the error. we then try to load the
data and filter it

	modified:   deeplabcut/post_processing/filtering.py

* REF: Reduce the code within the try block

the second try block in filterpredictions looked for the analyzed file
and performed operations to filter it - and if the file is not found,
continue to the next item in the for loop.

this commit reduces the try block to only load the analyzed file and
immediately catch the error and continue if the file doesnt exist.

the rest of the filtering on the analyzed data is performed outside the
try/except block.

	modified:   deeplabcut/post_processing/filtering.py

* FEAT: Return video filename to filtered dataframe mapping

the filterpredictions now returns a mapping instead of returning None.

	modified:   deeplabcut/post_processing/filtering.py

* REF: Reduce scope of try/except

instead of finding and analyzing the skeleton in the try block, this
commit reduces the scope of the try block to only finding the file and
moves the skeleton calculations to outside the try/except.

	modified:   deeplabcut/post_processing/analyze_skeleton.py

* FIX: Actually return the mapping

	modified:   deeplabcut/post_processing/filtering.py

* FEAT: Return mapping from video filename to skeleton dataframe

the analyze_skeleton function now returns a mapping instead of None

"Address underlying compatibility issue with scipy 1.11.0 (#2396)

See warning in scipy 1.9's documentation.
See warning in https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-1.9.0/reference/generated/scipy.stats.mode.html

The SPEC0 suggests that scipy 1.8 be dropped in 2024, but I think it is
OK to drop it a little early.

If you don't want to drop it, we could add a version check for the
keyword argument, but that seems a little much.

The keyword argument `keepdims` was added in scipy 1.9

Additionally, in some cases internal links were defined using a path to
the file - these too have been updated to use the new references.

Two broken links were also fixed in this commit.

"Experiment : API documentation in Jupyter Book docs (#1795)

* DOC: Include API documentation in jupyter book docs

At the moment, the API documentation seems to be hosted manually
in the GitHub wiki on the DeepLabCut repository. Links to sections
of the wiki are provided in the jupyter book docs. This is not ideal
as the wiki needs to be maintained manually every time changes are
made to the docstrings.

This is a proof of concept to include the api documentation in the
jupyter book docs directly. This is achieved using the special
eval-rst directive and by manually including an rst file in the
docs. The included rst file is manually created to document the
function.

Additionally, the numpydoc extension is included to conform to
existing standards in the ecosystem and make the docs easier to
read.

In order to build the jupyter book docs now, the deeplabcut package
needs to be installed - and the numpydoc package.

* Update DEEPLABCUT.yaml

Users appear to be grabbing `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` from the repo in order to install `2.2rc3`. Unfortunately, it installs 2.1.10.4, and gets tables from conda rather than pip. Therefore, the instructions elsewhere to install the newest versions of the code with this conda env file are inaccurate. 

To eliminate confusion, the repo version of `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` should be updated to the same as the version on the blog.

On windows 10, I have tried using the existing repo file to install 2.1.10.4, then running `pip install deeplabcut[gui]==2.2rc3`. While it appears to install ok, I get a tables error (seen in #1368 and #1398 ).

One thing I have been confused about since moving to maDLC has been how to extract outlier frames from analyzed video (as was typical in the single animal workflow) to use the refine labels toolbox. I would convert to tracklets, but need better detection before the refine tracklets GUI would work. For example, I could run the refine tracklets GUI, but some points would be non existent so I couldn't refine them. I was stuck just manually extracting frames without the efficiency and power of the extract outliers functions.  I couldn't find anything in the documentation, and I believe others have had the same problem based on posts on gitter and image.sc. I've tried to add basic instructions (including a GUI workaround for less experienced users, and a mention of the command line call for advanced users).",1

linked to external files on github instead of linking to the same files

Additionally, in some cases internal links were defined using a path to
the file - these too have been updated to use the new references.

Two broken links were also fixed in this commit.

"Experiment : API documentation in Jupyter Book docs (#1795)

* DOC: Include API documentation in jupyter book docs

At the moment, the API documentation seems to be hosted manually
in the GitHub wiki on the DeepLabCut repository. Links to sections
of the wiki are provided in the jupyter book docs. This is not ideal
as the wiki needs to be maintained manually every time changes are
made to the docstrings.

This is a proof of concept to include the api documentation in the
jupyter book docs directly. This is achieved using the special
eval-rst directive and by manually including an rst file in the
docs. The included rst file is manually created to document the
function.

Additionally, the numpydoc extension is included to conform to
existing standards in the ecosystem and make the docs easier to
read.

In order to build the jupyter book docs now, the deeplabcut package
needs to be installed - and the numpydoc package.

* Update DEEPLABCUT.yaml

Users appear to be grabbing `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` from the repo in order to install `2.2rc3`. Unfortunately, it installs 2.1.10.4, and gets tables from conda rather than pip. Therefore, the instructions elsewhere to install the newest versions of the code with this conda env file are inaccurate. 

To eliminate confusion, the repo version of `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` should be updated to the same as the version on the blog.

On windows 10, I have tried using the existing repo file to install 2.1.10.4, then running `pip install deeplabcut[gui]==2.2rc3`. While it appears to install ok, I get a tables error (seen in #1368 and #1398 ).

One thing I have been confused about since moving to maDLC has been how to extract outlier frames from analyzed video (as was typical in the single animal workflow) to use the refine labels toolbox. I would convert to tracklets, but need better detection before the refine tracklets GUI would work. For example, I could run the refine tracklets GUI, but some points would be non existent so I couldn't refine them. I was stuck just manually extracting frames without the efficiency and power of the extract outliers functions.  I couldn't find anything in the documentation, and I believe others have had the same problem based on posts on gitter and image.sc. I've tried to add basic instructions (including a GUI workaround for less experienced users, and a mention of the command line call for advanced users).",1

and performed operations to filter it - and if the file is not found,
continue to the next item in the for loop.

this commit reduces the try block to only load the analyzed file and
immediately catch the error and continue if the file doesnt exist.

the rest of the filtering on the analyzed data is performed outside the
try/except block.

	modified:   deeplabcut/post_processing/filtering.py

* FEAT: Return video filename to filtered dataframe mapping

the filterpredictions now returns a mapping instead of returning None.

	modified:   deeplabcut/post_processing/filtering.py

* REF: Reduce scope of try/except

instead of finding and analyzing the skeleton in the try block, this
commit reduces the scope of the try block to only finding the file and
moves the skeleton calculations to outside the try/except.

	modified:   deeplabcut/post_processing/analyze_skeleton.py

* FIX: Actually return the mapping

	modified:   deeplabcut/post_processing/filtering.py

* FEAT: Return mapping from video filename to skeleton dataframe

the analyze_skeleton function now returns a mapping instead of None

	modified:   deeplabcut/post_processing/analyze_skeleton.py

* Add return_data flag

See warning in scipy 1.9's documentation.
See warning in https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-1.9.0/reference/generated/scipy.stats.mode.html

The SPEC0 suggests that scipy 1.8 be dropped in 2024, but I think it is
OK to drop it a little early.

If you don't want to drop it, we could add a version check for the
keyword argument, but that seems a little much.

The keyword argument `keepdims` was added in scipy 1.9

There were a number of places where the jupyter book documentation
linked to external files on github instead of linking to the same files
on jupyter book. This commit fixes that issue.

Additionally, in some cases internal links were defined using a path to
the file - these too have been updated to use the new references.

Two broken links were also fixed in this commit.

"Experiment : API documentation in Jupyter Book docs (#1795)

* DOC: Include API documentation in jupyter book docs

At the moment, the API documentation seems to be hosted manually
in the GitHub wiki on the DeepLabCut repository. Links to sections
of the wiki are provided in the jupyter book docs. This is not ideal
as the wiki needs to be maintained manually every time changes are
made to the docstrings.

This is a proof of concept to include the api documentation in the
jupyter book docs directly. This is achieved using the special
eval-rst directive and by manually including an rst file in the
docs. The included rst file is manually created to document the
function.

Additionally, the numpydoc extension is included to conform to
existing standards in the ecosystem and make the docs easier to
read.

In order to build the jupyter book docs now, the deeplabcut package
needs to be installed - and the numpydoc package.

* Update DEEPLABCUT.yaml

Users appear to be grabbing `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` from the repo in order to install `2.2rc3`. Unfortunately, it installs 2.1.10.4, and gets tables from conda rather than pip. Therefore, the instructions elsewhere to install the newest versions of the code with this conda env file are inaccurate. 

To eliminate confusion, the repo version of `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` should be updated to the same as the version on the blog.

On windows 10, I have tried using the existing repo file to install 2.1.10.4, then running `pip install deeplabcut[gui]==2.2rc3`. While it appears to install ok, I get a tables error (seen in #1368 and #1398 ). Uninstalling pytables with conda and reinstalling with pip works sometimes (#1368), but just now I tested it again and created a tensorflow error.",0

"Update maDLC_AdvUserGuide.md (#923)

One thing I have been confused about since moving to maDLC has been how to extract outlier frames from analyzed video (as was typical in the single animal workflow) to use the refine labels toolbox. I would convert to tracklets, but need better detection before the refine tracklets GUI would work. For example, I could run the refine tracklets GUI, but some points would be non existent so I couldn't refine them. I was stuck just manually extracting frames without the efficiency and power of the extract outliers functions.  I couldn't find anything in the documentation, and I believe others have had the same problem based on posts on gitter and image.sc. I've tried to add basic instructions (including a GUI workaround for less experienced users, and a mention of the command line call for advanced users).",1

"""deeplabcut.filterpredictions"" and ""deeplabcut.analyze_skeleton"" return mappings (#1908)

* REF: Denest filterpredictions for loop

there were two try/excepts, one within the other.
this commit simplifies the code by pulling the inner try/except out.

the code now tries to look for filtered data. if filtered data is found
for the video, we continue to the next item in the loop.

if not found, we catch and ignore the error. we then try to load the
data and filter it

	modified:   deeplabcut/post_processing/filtering.py

* REF: Reduce the code within the try block

the second try block in filterpredictions looked for the analyzed file
and performed operations to filter it - and if the file is not found,
continue to the next item in the for loop.

this commit reduces the try block to only load the analyzed file and
immediately catch the error and continue if the file doesnt exist.

the rest of the filtering on the analyzed data is performed outside the
try/except block.

	modified:   deeplabcut/post_processing/filtering.py

* FEAT: Return video filename to filtered dataframe mapping

the filterpredictions now returns a mapping instead of returning None.

	modified:   deeplabcut/post_processing/filtering.py

* REF: Reduce scope of try/except

instead of finding and analyzing the skeleton in the try block, this
commit reduces the scope of the try block to only finding the file and
moves the skeleton calculations to outside the try/except.

	modified:   deeplabcut/post_processing/analyze_skeleton.py

* FIX: Actually return the mapping

	modified:   deeplabcut/post_processing/filtering.py

* FEAT: Return mapping from video filename to skeleton dataframe

the analyze_skeleton function now returns a mapping instead of None

The SPEC0 suggests that scipy 1.8 be dropped in 2024, but I think it is
OK to drop it a little early.

If you don't want to drop it, we could add a version check for the

There were a number of places where the jupyter book documentation
linked to external files on github instead of linking to the same files

Additionally, in some cases internal links were defined using a path to
the file - these too have been updated to use the new references.

Two broken links were also fixed in this commit.

"Experiment : API documentation in Jupyter Book docs (#1795)

* DOC: Include API documentation in jupyter book docs

At the moment, the API documentation seems to be hosted manually
in the GitHub wiki on the DeepLabCut repository. Links to sections
of the wiki are provided in the jupyter book docs. This is not ideal
as the wiki needs to be maintained manually every time changes are
made to the docstrings.

This is a proof of concept to include the api documentation in the
jupyter book docs directly. This is achieved using the special
eval-rst directive and by manually including an rst file in the
docs. The included rst file is manually created to document the
function.

Additionally, the numpydoc extension is included to conform to
existing standards in the ecosystem and make the docs easier to
read.

In order to build the jupyter book docs now, the deeplabcut package
needs to be installed - and the numpydoc package.

* Update DEEPLABCUT.yaml

Users appear to be grabbing `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` from the repo in order to install `2.2rc3`. Unfortunately, it installs 2.1.10.4, and gets tables from conda rather than pip. Therefore, the instructions elsewhere to install the newest versions of the code with this conda env file are inaccurate. 

To eliminate confusion, the repo version of `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` should be updated to the same as the version on the blog.

On windows 10, I have tried using the existing repo file to install 2.1.10.4, then running `pip install deeplabcut[gui]==2.2rc3`. While it appears to install ok, I get a tables error (seen in #1368 and #1398 ).

One thing I have been confused about since moving to maDLC has been how to extract outlier frames from analyzed video (as was typical in the single animal workflow) to use the refine labels toolbox. I would convert to tracklets, but need better detection before the refine tracklets GUI would work. For example, I could run the refine tracklets GUI, but some points would be non existent so I couldn't refine them. I was stuck just manually extracting frames without the efficiency and power of the extract outliers functions.  I couldn't find anything in the documentation, and I believe others have had the same problem based on posts on gitter and image.sc. I've tried to add basic instructions (including a GUI workaround for less experienced users, and a mention of the command line call for advanced users).",1

"""deeplabcut.filterpredictions"" and ""deeplabcut.analyze_skeleton"" return mappings (#1908)

* REF: Denest filterpredictions for loop

there were two try/excepts, one within the other.
this commit simplifies the code by pulling the inner try/except out.

the code now tries to look for filtered data. if filtered data is found
for the video, we continue to the next item in the loop.

if not found, we catch and ignore the error. we then try to load the
data and filter it

	modified:   deeplabcut/post_processing/filtering.py

* REF: Reduce the code within the try block

the second try block in filterpredictions looked for the analyzed file
and performed operations to filter it - and if the file is not found,
continue to the next item in the for loop.

this commit reduces the try block to only load the analyzed file and
immediately catch the error and continue if the file doesnt exist.

the rest of the filtering on the analyzed data is performed outside the
try/except block.

	modified:   deeplabcut/post_processing/filtering.py

* FEAT: Return video filename to filtered dataframe mapping

the filterpredictions now returns a mapping instead of returning None.

	modified:   deeplabcut/post_processing/filtering.py

* REF: Reduce scope of try/except

instead of finding and analyzing the skeleton in the try block, this
commit reduces the scope of the try block to only finding the file and
moves the skeleton calculations to outside the try/except.

	modified:   deeplabcut/post_processing/analyze_skeleton.py

* FIX: Actually return the mapping

	modified:   deeplabcut/post_processing/filtering.py

* FEAT: Return mapping from video filename to skeleton dataframe

the analyze_skeleton function now returns a mapping instead of None

The SPEC0 suggests that scipy 1.8 be dropped in 2024, but I think it is
OK to drop it a little early.

If you don't want to drop it, we could add a version check for the
keyword argument, but that seems a little much.

There were a number of places where the jupyter book documentation
linked to external files on github instead of linking to the same files
on jupyter book. This commit fixes that issue.

Additionally, in some cases internal links were defined using a path to
the file - these too have been updated to use the new references.

Two broken links were also fixed in this commit.

"Experiment : API documentation in Jupyter Book docs (#1795)

* DOC: Include API documentation in jupyter book docs

At the moment, the API documentation seems to be hosted manually
in the GitHub wiki on the DeepLabCut repository. Links to sections
of the wiki are provided in the jupyter book docs. This is not ideal
as the wiki needs to be maintained manually every time changes are
made to the docstrings.

This is a proof of concept to include the api documentation in the
jupyter book docs directly. This is achieved using the special
eval-rst directive and by manually including an rst file in the
docs. The included rst file is manually created to document the
function.

Additionally, the numpydoc extension is included to conform to
existing standards in the ecosystem and make the docs easier to
read.

In order to build the jupyter book docs now, the deeplabcut package
needs to be installed - and the numpydoc package.

* Update DEEPLABCUT.yaml

Users appear to be grabbing `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` from the repo in order to install `2.2rc3`. Unfortunately, it installs 2.1.10.4, and gets tables from conda rather than pip. Therefore, the instructions elsewhere to install the newest versions of the code with this conda env file are inaccurate. 

To eliminate confusion, the repo version of `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` should be updated to the same as the version on the blog.

On windows 10, I have tried using the existing repo file to install 2.1.10.4, then running `pip install deeplabcut[gui]==2.2rc3`. While it appears to install ok, I get a tables error (seen in #1368 and #1398 ). Uninstalling pytables with conda and reinstalling with pip works sometimes (#1368), but just now I tested it again and created a tensorflow error.",0

"Update maDLC_AdvUserGuide.md (#923)

One thing I have been confused about since moving to maDLC has been how to extract outlier frames from analyzed video (as was typical in the single animal workflow) to use the refine labels toolbox. I would convert to tracklets, but need better detection before the refine tracklets GUI would work. For example, I could run the refine tracklets GUI, but some points would be non existent so I couldn't refine them. I was stuck just manually extracting frames without the efficiency and power of the extract outliers functions.  I couldn't find anything in the documentation, and I believe others have had the same problem based on posts on gitter and image.sc. I've tried to add basic instructions (including a GUI workaround for less experienced users, and a mention of the command line call for advanced users).",1

"""deeplabcut.filterpredictions"" and ""deeplabcut.analyze_skeleton"" return mappings (#1908)

* REF: Denest filterpredictions for loop

there were two try/excepts, one within the other.
this commit simplifies the code by pulling the inner try/except out.

the code now tries to look for filtered data. if filtered data is found
for the video, we continue to the next item in the loop.

if not found, we catch and ignore the error. we then try to load the
data and filter it

	modified:   deeplabcut/post_processing/filtering.py

* REF: Reduce the code within the try block

the second try block in filterpredictions looked for the analyzed file
and performed operations to filter it - and if the file is not found,
continue to the next item in the for loop.

this commit reduces the try block to only load the analyzed file and
immediately catch the error and continue if the file doesnt exist.

the rest of the filtering on the analyzed data is performed outside the
try/except block.

	modified:   deeplabcut/post_processing/filtering.py

* FEAT: Return video filename to filtered dataframe mapping

the filterpredictions now returns a mapping instead of returning None.

	modified:   deeplabcut/post_processing/filtering.py

* REF: Reduce scope of try/except

instead of finding and analyzing the skeleton in the try block, this
commit reduces the scope of the try block to only finding the file and
moves the skeleton calculations to outside the try/except.

	modified:   deeplabcut/post_processing/analyze_skeleton.py

* FIX: Actually return the mapping

	modified:   deeplabcut/post_processing/filtering.py

* FEAT: Return mapping from video filename to skeleton dataframe

The SPEC0 suggests that scipy 1.8 be dropped in 2024, but I think it is
OK to drop it a little early.

If you don't want to drop it, we could add a version check for the

Additionally, in some cases internal links were defined using a path to
the file - these too have been updated to use the new references.

Two broken links were also fixed in this commit.

"Experiment : API documentation in Jupyter Book docs (#1795)

* DOC: Include API documentation in jupyter book docs

At the moment, the API documentation seems to be hosted manually
in the GitHub wiki on the DeepLabCut repository. Links to sections
of the wiki are provided in the jupyter book docs. This is not ideal
as the wiki needs to be maintained manually every time changes are
made to the docstrings.

This is a proof of concept to include the api documentation in the
jupyter book docs directly. This is achieved using the special
eval-rst directive and by manually including an rst file in the
docs. The included rst file is manually created to document the
function.

Additionally, the numpydoc extension is included to conform to
existing standards in the ecosystem and make the docs easier to
read.

In order to build the jupyter book docs now, the deeplabcut package
needs to be installed - and the numpydoc package.

"Update DEEPLABCUT.yaml (#1400)

* Update DEEPLABCUT.yaml

Users appear to be grabbing `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` from the repo in order to install `2.2rc3`. Unfortunately, it installs 2.1.10.4, and gets tables from conda rather than pip. Therefore, the instructions elsewhere to install the newest versions of the code with this conda env file are inaccurate. 

To eliminate confusion, the repo version of `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` should be updated to the same as the version on the blog.

On windows 10, I have tried using the existing repo file to install 2.1.10.4, then running `pip install deeplabcut[gui]==2.2rc3`. While it appears to install ok, I get a tables error (seen in #1368 and #1398 ). Uninstalling pytables with conda and reinstalling with pip works sometimes (#1368), but just now I tested it again and created a tensorflow error.",0

One thing I have been confused about since moving to maDLC has been how to extract outlier frames from analyzed video (as was typical in the single animal workflow) to use the refine labels toolbox. I would convert to tracklets, but need better detection before the refine tracklets GUI would work. For example, I could run the refine tracklets GUI, but some points would be non existent so I couldn't refine them. I was stuck just manually extracting frames without the efficiency and power of the extract outliers functions.  I couldn't find anything in the documentation, and I believe others have had the same problem based on posts on gitter and image.sc. I've tried to add basic instructions (including a GUI workaround for less experienced users, and a mention of the command line call for advanced users).",1

The SPEC0 suggests that scipy 1.8 be dropped in 2024, but I think it is
OK to drop it a little early.

If you don't want to drop it, we could add a version check for the

"Experiment : API documentation in Jupyter Book docs (#1795)

* DOC: Include API documentation in jupyter book docs

At the moment, the API documentation seems to be hosted manually
in the GitHub wiki on the DeepLabCut repository. Links to sections
of the wiki are provided in the jupyter book docs. This is not ideal
as the wiki needs to be maintained manually every time changes are
made to the docstrings.

This is a proof of concept to include the api documentation in the
jupyter book docs directly. This is achieved using the special
eval-rst directive and by manually including an rst file in the
docs. The included rst file is manually created to document the
function.

Additionally, the numpydoc extension is included to conform to
existing standards in the ecosystem and make the docs easier to
read.

In order to build the jupyter book docs now, the deeplabcut package
needs to be installed - and the numpydoc package.

* Update DEEPLABCUT.yaml

Users appear to be grabbing `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` from the repo in order to install `2.2rc3`. Unfortunately, it installs 2.1.10.4, and gets tables from conda rather than pip. Therefore, the instructions elsewhere to install the newest versions of the code with this conda env file are inaccurate. 

To eliminate confusion, the repo version of `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` should be updated to the same as the version on the blog.

On windows 10, I have tried using the existing repo file to install 2.1.10.4, then running `pip install deeplabcut[gui]==2.2rc3`. While it appears to install ok, I get a tables error (seen in #1368 and #1398 ).

One thing I have been confused about since moving to maDLC has been how to extract outlier frames from analyzed video (as was typical in the single animal workflow) to use the refine labels toolbox. I would convert to tracklets, but need better detection before the refine tracklets GUI would work. For example, I could run the refine tracklets GUI, but some points would be non existent so I couldn't refine them. I was stuck just manually extracting frames without the efficiency and power of the extract outliers functions.  I couldn't find anything in the documentation, and I believe others have had the same problem based on posts on gitter and image.sc. I've tried to add basic instructions (including a GUI workaround for less experienced users, and a mention of the command line call for advanced users).",1

Additionally, in some cases internal links were defined using a path to
the file - these too have been updated to use the new references.

Two broken links were also fixed in this commit.

"Experiment : API documentation in Jupyter Book docs (#1795)

* DOC: Include API documentation in jupyter book docs

At the moment, the API documentation seems to be hosted manually
in the GitHub wiki on the DeepLabCut repository. Links to sections
of the wiki are provided in the jupyter book docs. This is not ideal
as the wiki needs to be maintained manually every time changes are
made to the docstrings.

This is a proof of concept to include the api documentation in the
jupyter book docs directly. This is achieved using the special
eval-rst directive and by manually including an rst file in the
docs. The included rst file is manually created to document the
function.

Additionally, the numpydoc extension is included to conform to
existing standards in the ecosystem and make the docs easier to
read.

In order to build the jupyter book docs now, the deeplabcut package
needs to be installed - and the numpydoc package.

* Update DEEPLABCUT.yaml

Users appear to be grabbing `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` from the repo in order to install `2.2rc3`. Unfortunately, it installs 2.1.10.4, and gets tables from conda rather than pip. Therefore, the instructions elsewhere to install the newest versions of the code with this conda env file are inaccurate. 

To eliminate confusion, the repo version of `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` should be updated to the same as the version on the blog.

On windows 10, I have tried using the existing repo file to install 2.1.10.4, then running `pip install deeplabcut[gui]==2.2rc3`. While it appears to install ok, I get a tables error (seen in #1368 and #1398 ). Uninstalling pytables with conda and reinstalling with pip works sometimes (#1368), but just now I tested it again and created a tensorflow error.",0

One thing I have been confused about since moving to maDLC has been how to extract outlier frames from analyzed video (as was typical in the single animal workflow) to use the refine labels toolbox. I would convert to tracklets, but need better detection before the refine tracklets GUI would work. For example, I could run the refine tracklets GUI, but some points would be non existent so I couldn't refine them. I was stuck just manually extracting frames without the efficiency and power of the extract outliers functions.  I couldn't find anything in the documentation, and I believe others have had the same problem based on posts on gitter and image.sc. I've tried to add basic instructions (including a GUI workaround for less experienced users, and a mention of the command line call for advanced users).",1

Two things here:

  regular expression isn't a Qt Regular Expression

Additionally, in some cases internal links were defined using a path to
the file - these too have been updated to use the new references.

Two broken links were also fixed in this commit.

the api docs files have been renamed for ease of understanding.
earlier, the filenames were the paths to the module which contained
the function. now, the filenames are just deeplabcut.function_name.

note that this is also done as multiple functions defined in
the same module needed to be documented separately

"Experiment : API documentation in Jupyter Book docs (#1795)

* DOC: Include API documentation in jupyter book docs

At the moment, the API documentation seems to be hosted manually
in the GitHub wiki on the DeepLabCut repository. Links to sections
of the wiki are provided in the jupyter book docs. This is not ideal
as the wiki needs to be maintained manually every time changes are
made to the docstrings.

This is a proof of concept to include the api documentation in the
jupyter book docs directly. This is achieved using the special
eval-rst directive and by manually including an rst file in the
docs. The included rst file is manually created to document the
function.

Additionally, the numpydoc extension is included to conform to
existing standards in the ecosystem and make the docs easier to
read.

In order to build the jupyter book docs now, the deeplabcut package
needs to be installed - and the numpydoc package.

* Update DEEPLABCUT.yaml

Users appear to be grabbing `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` from the repo in order to install `2.2rc3`. Unfortunately, it installs 2.1.10.4, and gets tables from conda rather than pip. Therefore, the instructions elsewhere to install the newest versions of the code with this conda env file are inaccurate. 

To eliminate confusion, the repo version of `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` should be updated to the same as the version on the blog.

On windows 10, I have tried using the existing repo file to install 2.1.10.4, then running `pip install deeplabcut[gui]==2.2rc3`. While it appears to install ok, I get a tables error (seen in #1368 and #1398 ). Uninstalling pytables with conda and reinstalling with pip works sometimes (#1368), but just now I tested it again and created a tensorflow error.",0

One thing I have been confused about since moving to maDLC has been how to extract outlier frames from analyzed video (as was typical in the single animal workflow) to use the refine labels toolbox. I would convert to tracklets, but need better detection before the refine tracklets GUI would work. For example, I could run the refine tracklets GUI, but some points would be non existent so I couldn't refine them. I was stuck just manually extracting frames without the efficiency and power of the extract outliers functions.  I couldn't find anything in the documentation, and I believe others have had the same problem based on posts on gitter and image.sc. I've tried to add basic instructions (including a GUI workaround for less experienced users, and a mention of the command line call for advanced users).",1

linked to external files on github instead of linking to the same files

Additionally, in some cases internal links were defined using a path to
the file - these too have been updated to use the new references.

Two broken links were also fixed in this commit.

"Experiment : API documentation in Jupyter Book docs (#1795)

* DOC: Include API documentation in jupyter book docs

At the moment, the API documentation seems to be hosted manually
in the GitHub wiki on the DeepLabCut repository. Links to sections
of the wiki are provided in the jupyter book docs. This is not ideal
as the wiki needs to be maintained manually every time changes are
made to the docstrings.

This is a proof of concept to include the api documentation in the
jupyter book docs directly. This is achieved using the special
eval-rst directive and by manually including an rst file in the
docs. The included rst file is manually created to document the
function.

Additionally, the numpydoc extension is included to conform to
existing standards in the ecosystem and make the docs easier to
read.

In order to build the jupyter book docs now, the deeplabcut package
needs to be installed - and the numpydoc package.

"Update DEEPLABCUT.yaml (#1400)

* Update DEEPLABCUT.yaml

Users appear to be grabbing `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` from the repo in order to install `2.2rc3`. Unfortunately, it installs 2.1.10.4, and gets tables from conda rather than pip. Therefore, the instructions elsewhere to install the newest versions of the code with this conda env file are inaccurate. 

To eliminate confusion, the repo version of `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` should be updated to the same as the version on the blog.

On windows 10, I have tried using the existing repo file to install 2.1.10.4, then running `pip install deeplabcut[gui]==2.2rc3`. While it appears to install ok, I get a tables error (seen in #1368 and #1398 ). Uninstalling pytables with conda and reinstalling with pip works sometimes (#1368), but just now I tested it again and created a tensorflow error.",0

One thing I have been confused about since moving to maDLC has been how to extract outlier frames from analyzed video (as was typical in the single animal workflow) to use the refine labels toolbox. I would convert to tracklets, but need better detection before the refine tracklets GUI would work. For example, I could run the refine tracklets GUI, but some points would be non existent so I couldn't refine them. I was stuck just manually extracting frames without the efficiency and power of the extract outliers functions.  I couldn't find anything in the documentation, and I believe others have had the same problem based on posts on gitter and image.sc. I've tried to add basic instructions (including a GUI workaround for less experienced users, and a mention of the command line call for advanced users).",1

Additionally, in some cases internal links were defined using a path to
the file - these too have been updated to use the new references.

Two broken links were also fixed in this commit.

"Experiment : API documentation in Jupyter Book docs (#1795)

* DOC: Include API documentation in jupyter book docs

At the moment, the API documentation seems to be hosted manually
in the GitHub wiki on the DeepLabCut repository. Links to sections
of the wiki are provided in the jupyter book docs. This is not ideal
as the wiki needs to be maintained manually every time changes are
made to the docstrings.

This is a proof of concept to include the api documentation in the
jupyter book docs directly. This is achieved using the special
eval-rst directive and by manually including an rst file in the
docs. The included rst file is manually created to document the
function.

Additionally, the numpydoc extension is included to conform to
existing standards in the ecosystem and make the docs easier to
read.

In order to build the jupyter book docs now, the deeplabcut package
needs to be installed - and the numpydoc package.

"Update DEEPLABCUT.yaml (#1400)

* Update DEEPLABCUT.yaml

Users appear to be grabbing `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` from the repo in order to install `2.2rc3`. Unfortunately, it installs 2.1.10.4, and gets tables from conda rather than pip. Therefore, the instructions elsewhere to install the newest versions of the code with this conda env file are inaccurate. 

To eliminate confusion, the repo version of `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` should be updated to the same as the version on the blog.

On windows 10, I have tried using the existing repo file to install 2.1.10.4, then running `pip install deeplabcut[gui]==2.2rc3`. While it appears to install ok, I get a tables error (seen in #1368 and #1398 ). Uninstalling pytables with conda and reinstalling with pip works sometimes (#1368), but just now I tested it again and created a tensorflow error.",0

"Update maDLC_AdvUserGuide.md (#923)

One thing I have been confused about since moving to maDLC has been how to extract outlier frames from analyzed video (as was typical in the single animal workflow) to use the refine labels toolbox. I would convert to tracklets, but need better detection before the refine tracklets GUI would work. For example, I could run the refine tracklets GUI, but some points would be non existent so I couldn't refine them. I was stuck just manually extracting frames without the efficiency and power of the extract outliers functions.  I couldn't find anything in the documentation, and I believe others have had the same problem based on posts on gitter and image.sc. I've tried to add basic instructions (including a GUI workaround for less experienced users, and a mention of the command line call for advanced users).",1

There were a number of places where the jupyter book documentation
linked to external files on github instead of linking to the same files
on jupyter book. This commit fixes that issue.

Additionally, in some cases internal links were defined using a path to
the file - these too have been updated to use the new references.

Two broken links were also fixed in this commit.

"Experiment : API documentation in Jupyter Book docs (#1795)

* DOC: Include API documentation in jupyter book docs

At the moment, the API documentation seems to be hosted manually
in the GitHub wiki on the DeepLabCut repository. Links to sections
of the wiki are provided in the jupyter book docs. This is not ideal
as the wiki needs to be maintained manually every time changes are
made to the docstrings.

This is a proof of concept to include the api documentation in the
jupyter book docs directly. This is achieved using the special
eval-rst directive and by manually including an rst file in the
docs. The included rst file is manually created to document the
function.

Additionally, the numpydoc extension is included to conform to
existing standards in the ecosystem and make the docs easier to
read.

In order to build the jupyter book docs now, the deeplabcut package
needs to be installed - and the numpydoc package.

* Update DEEPLABCUT.yaml

Users appear to be grabbing `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` from the repo in order to install `2.2rc3`. Unfortunately, it installs 2.1.10.4, and gets tables from conda rather than pip. Therefore, the instructions elsewhere to install the newest versions of the code with this conda env file are inaccurate. 

To eliminate confusion, the repo version of `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` should be updated to the same as the version on the blog.

On windows 10, I have tried using the existing repo file to install 2.1.10.4, then running `pip install deeplabcut[gui]==2.2rc3`. While it appears to install ok, I get a tables error (seen in #1368 and #1398 ). Uninstalling pytables with conda and reinstalling with pip works sometimes (#1368), but just now I tested it again and created a tensorflow error.",0

"Update maDLC_AdvUserGuide.md (#923)

One thing I have been confused about since moving to maDLC has been how to extract outlier frames from analyzed video (as was typical in the single animal workflow) to use the refine labels toolbox. I would convert to tracklets, but need better detection before the refine tracklets GUI would work. For example, I could run the refine tracklets GUI, but some points would be non existent so I couldn't refine them. I was stuck just manually extracting frames without the efficiency and power of the extract outliers functions.  I couldn't find anything in the documentation, and I believe others have had the same problem based on posts on gitter and image.sc. I've tried to add basic instructions (including a GUI workaround for less experienced users, and a mention of the command line call for advanced users).",1

"Experiment : API documentation in Jupyter Book docs (#1795)

* DOC: Include API documentation in jupyter book docs

At the moment, the API documentation seems to be hosted manually
in the GitHub wiki on the DeepLabCut repository. Links to sections
of the wiki are provided in the jupyter book docs. This is not ideal
as the wiki needs to be maintained manually every time changes are
made to the docstrings.

This is a proof of concept to include the api documentation in the
jupyter book docs directly. This is achieved using the special
eval-rst directive and by manually including an rst file in the
docs. The included rst file is manually created to document the
function.

Additionally, the numpydoc extension is included to conform to
existing standards in the ecosystem and make the docs easier to
read.

In order to build the jupyter book docs now, the deeplabcut package
needs to be installed - and the numpydoc package.

* Update DEEPLABCUT.yaml

Users appear to be grabbing `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` from the repo in order to install `2.2rc3`. Unfortunately, it installs 2.1.10.4, and gets tables from conda rather than pip. Therefore, the instructions elsewhere to install the newest versions of the code with this conda env file are inaccurate. 

To eliminate confusion, the repo version of `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` should be updated to the same as the version on the blog.

On windows 10, I have tried using the existing repo file to install 2.1.10.4, then running `pip install deeplabcut[gui]==2.2rc3`. While it appears to install ok, I get a tables error (seen in #1368 and #1398 ).

One thing I have been confused about since moving to maDLC has been how to extract outlier frames from analyzed video (as was typical in the single animal workflow) to use the refine labels toolbox. I would convert to tracklets, but need better detection before the refine tracklets GUI would work. For example, I could run the refine tracklets GUI, but some points would be non existent so I couldn't refine them. I was stuck just manually extracting frames without the efficiency and power of the extract outliers functions.  I couldn't find anything in the documentation, and I believe others have had the same problem based on posts on gitter and image.sc. I've tried to add basic instructions (including a GUI workaround for less experienced users, and a mention of the command line call for advanced users).",1

Additionally, in some cases internal links were defined using a path to

Two broken links were also fixed in this commit.

"Experiment : API documentation in Jupyter Book docs (#1795)

* DOC: Include API documentation in jupyter book docs

At the moment, the API documentation seems to be hosted manually
in the GitHub wiki on the DeepLabCut repository. Links to sections
of the wiki are provided in the jupyter book docs. This is not ideal
as the wiki needs to be maintained manually every time changes are
made to the docstrings.

This is a proof of concept to include the api documentation in the
jupyter book docs directly. This is achieved using the special
eval-rst directive and by manually including an rst file in the
docs. The included rst file is manually created to document the
function.

Additionally, the numpydoc extension is included to conform to
existing standards in the ecosystem and make the docs easier to
read.

In order to build the jupyter book docs now, the deeplabcut package
needs to be installed - and the numpydoc package.

* Update DEEPLABCUT.yaml

Users appear to be grabbing `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` from the repo in order to install `2.2rc3`. Unfortunately, it installs 2.1.10.4, and gets tables from conda rather than pip. Therefore, the instructions elsewhere to install the newest versions of the code with this conda env file are inaccurate. 

To eliminate confusion, the repo version of `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` should be updated to the same as the version on the blog.

On windows 10, I have tried using the existing repo file to install 2.1.10.4, then running `pip install deeplabcut[gui]==2.2rc3`. While it appears to install ok, I get a tables error (seen in #1368 and #1398 ).

One thing I have been confused about since moving to maDLC has been how to extract outlier frames from analyzed video (as was typical in the single animal workflow) to use the refine labels toolbox. I would convert to tracklets, but need better detection before the refine tracklets GUI would work. For example, I could run the refine tracklets GUI, but some points would be non existent so I couldn't refine them. I was stuck just manually extracting frames without the efficiency and power of the extract outliers functions.  I couldn't find anything in the documentation, and I believe others have had the same problem based on posts on gitter and image.sc. I've tried to add basic instructions (including a GUI workaround for less experienced users, and a mention of the command line call for advanced users).",1

Additionally, in some cases internal links were defined using a path to
the file - these too have been updated to use the new references.

Two broken links were also fixed in this commit.

"Experiment : API documentation in Jupyter Book docs (#1795)

* DOC: Include API documentation in jupyter book docs

At the moment, the API documentation seems to be hosted manually
in the GitHub wiki on the DeepLabCut repository. Links to sections
of the wiki are provided in the jupyter book docs. This is not ideal
as the wiki needs to be maintained manually every time changes are
made to the docstrings.

This is a proof of concept to include the api documentation in the
jupyter book docs directly. This is achieved using the special
eval-rst directive and by manually including an rst file in the
docs. The included rst file is manually created to document the
function.

Additionally, the numpydoc extension is included to conform to
existing standards in the ecosystem and make the docs easier to
read.

In order to build the jupyter book docs now, the deeplabcut package
needs to be installed - and the numpydoc package.

* DEV: Install the package when building jupyter book docs

and add a new docs extras require that installs numpydoc.
also remove unnnecessary sphinx extensions from the jupyter book

"Update DEEPLABCUT.yaml (#1400)

* Update DEEPLABCUT.yaml

Users appear to be grabbing `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` from the repo in order to install `2.2rc3`. Unfortunately, it installs 2.1.10.4, and gets tables from conda rather than pip. Therefore, the instructions elsewhere to install the newest versions of the code with this conda env file are inaccurate. 

To eliminate confusion, the repo version of `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` should be updated to the same as the version on the blog.

On windows 10, I have tried using the existing repo file to install 2.1.10.4, then running `pip install deeplabcut[gui]==2.2rc3`. While it appears to install ok, I get a tables error (seen in #1368 and #1398 ). Uninstalling pytables with conda and reinstalling with pip works sometimes (#1368), but just now I tested it again and created a tensorflow error.",0

One thing I have been confused about since moving to maDLC has been how to extract outlier frames from analyzed video (as was typical in the single animal workflow) to use the refine labels toolbox. I would convert to tracklets, but need better detection before the refine tracklets GUI would work. For example, I could run the refine tracklets GUI, but some points would be non existent so I couldn't refine them. I was stuck just manually extracting frames without the efficiency and power of the extract outliers functions.  I couldn't find anything in the documentation, and I believe others have had the same problem based on posts on gitter and image.sc. I've tried to add basic instructions (including a GUI workaround for less experienced users, and a mention of the command line call for advanced users).",1

"Experiment : API documentation in Jupyter Book docs (#1795)

* DOC: Include API documentation in jupyter book docs

At the moment, the API documentation seems to be hosted manually
in the GitHub wiki on the DeepLabCut repository. Links to sections
of the wiki are provided in the jupyter book docs. This is not ideal
as the wiki needs to be maintained manually every time changes are
made to the docstrings.

This is a proof of concept to include the api documentation in the
jupyter book docs directly. This is achieved using the special
eval-rst directive and by manually including an rst file in the
docs. The included rst file is manually created to document the
function.

Additionally, the numpydoc extension is included to conform to
existing standards in the ecosystem and make the docs easier to
read.

In order to build the jupyter book docs now, the deeplabcut package
needs to be installed - and the numpydoc package.

"Update DEEPLABCUT.yaml (#1400)

* Update DEEPLABCUT.yaml

Users appear to be grabbing `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` from the repo in order to install `2.2rc3`. Unfortunately, it installs 2.1.10.4, and gets tables from conda rather than pip. Therefore, the instructions elsewhere to install the newest versions of the code with this conda env file are inaccurate. 

To eliminate confusion, the repo version of `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` should be updated to the same as the version on the blog.

On windows 10, I have tried using the existing repo file to install 2.1.10.4, then running `pip install deeplabcut[gui]==2.2rc3`. While it appears to install ok, I get a tables error (seen in #1368 and #1398 ). Uninstalling pytables with conda and reinstalling with pip works sometimes (#1368), but just now I tested it again and created a tensorflow error.",0

One thing I have been confused about since moving to maDLC has been how to extract outlier frames from analyzed video (as was typical in the single animal workflow) to use the refine labels toolbox. I would convert to tracklets, but need better detection before the refine tracklets GUI would work. For example, I could run the refine tracklets GUI, but some points would be non existent so I couldn't refine them. I was stuck just manually extracting frames without the efficiency and power of the extract outliers functions.  I couldn't find anything in the documentation, and I believe others have had the same problem based on posts on gitter and image.sc. I've tried to add basic instructions (including a GUI workaround for less experienced users, and a mention of the command line call for advanced users).",1

There were a number of places where the jupyter book documentation
linked to external files on github instead of linking to the same files

Additionally, in some cases internal links were defined using a path to
the file - these too have been updated to use the new references.

Two broken links were also fixed in this commit.

"Experiment : API documentation in Jupyter Book docs (#1795)

* DOC: Include API documentation in jupyter book docs

At the moment, the API documentation seems to be hosted manually
in the GitHub wiki on the DeepLabCut repository. Links to sections
of the wiki are provided in the jupyter book docs. This is not ideal
as the wiki needs to be maintained manually every time changes are
made to the docstrings.

This is a proof of concept to include the api documentation in the
jupyter book docs directly. This is achieved using the special
eval-rst directive and by manually including an rst file in the
docs. The included rst file is manually created to document the
function.

Additionally, the numpydoc extension is included to conform to
existing standards in the ecosystem and make the docs easier to
read.

In order to build the jupyter book docs now, the deeplabcut package
needs to be installed - and the numpydoc package.

* Update DEEPLABCUT.yaml

Users appear to be grabbing `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` from the repo in order to install `2.2rc3`. Unfortunately, it installs 2.1.10.4, and gets tables from conda rather than pip. Therefore, the instructions elsewhere to install the newest versions of the code with this conda env file are inaccurate. 

To eliminate confusion, the repo version of `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` should be updated to the same as the version on the blog.

On windows 10, I have tried using the existing repo file to install 2.1.10.4, then running `pip install deeplabcut[gui]==2.2rc3`. While it appears to install ok, I get a tables error (seen in #1368 and #1398 ).

One thing I have been confused about since moving to maDLC has been how to extract outlier frames from analyzed video (as was typical in the single animal workflow) to use the refine labels toolbox. I would convert to tracklets, but need better detection before the refine tracklets GUI would work. For example, I could run the refine tracklets GUI, but some points would be non existent so I couldn't refine them. I was stuck just manually extracting frames without the efficiency and power of the extract outliers functions.  I couldn't find anything in the documentation, and I believe others have had the same problem based on posts on gitter and image.sc. I've tried to add basic instructions (including a GUI workaround for less experienced users, and a mention of the command line call for advanced users).",1

"Update DEEPLABCUT.yaml (#1400)

* Update DEEPLABCUT.yaml

Users appear to be grabbing `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` from the repo in order to install `2.2rc3`. Unfortunately, it installs 2.1.10.4, and gets tables from conda rather than pip. Therefore, the instructions elsewhere to install the newest versions of the code with this conda env file are inaccurate. 

To eliminate confusion, the repo version of `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` should be updated to the same as the version on the blog.

On windows 10, I have tried using the existing repo file to install 2.1.10.4, then running `pip install deeplabcut[gui]==2.2rc3`. While it appears to install ok, I get a tables error (seen in #1368 and #1398 ). Uninstalling pytables with conda and reinstalling with pip works sometimes (#1368), but just now I tested it again and created a tensorflow error.",0

One thing I have been confused about since moving to maDLC has been how to extract outlier frames from analyzed video (as was typical in the single animal workflow) to use the refine labels toolbox. I would convert to tracklets, but need better detection before the refine tracklets GUI would work. For example, I could run the refine tracklets GUI, but some points would be non existent so I couldn't refine them. I was stuck just manually extracting frames without the efficiency and power of the extract outliers functions.  I couldn't find anything in the documentation, and I believe others have had the same problem based on posts on gitter and image.sc. I've tried to add basic instructions (including a GUI workaround for less experienced users, and a mention of the command line call for advanced users).",1

* Update DEEPLABCUT.yaml

Users appear to be grabbing `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` from the repo in order to install `2.2rc3`. Unfortunately, it installs 2.1.10.4, and gets tables from conda rather than pip. Therefore, the instructions elsewhere to install the newest versions of the code with this conda env file are inaccurate. 

To eliminate confusion, the repo version of `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` should be updated to the same as the version on the blog.

On windows 10, I have tried using the existing repo file to install 2.1.10.4, then running `pip install deeplabcut[gui]==2.2rc3`. While it appears to install ok, I get a tables error (seen in #1368 and #1398 ). Uninstalling pytables with conda and reinstalling with pip works sometimes (#1368), but just now I tested it again and created a tensorflow error.",0

One thing I have been confused about since moving to maDLC has been how to extract outlier frames from analyzed video (as was typical in the single animal workflow) to use the refine labels toolbox. I would convert to tracklets, but need better detection before the refine tracklets GUI would work. For example, I could run the refine tracklets GUI, but some points would be non existent so I couldn't refine them. I was stuck just manually extracting frames without the efficiency and power of the extract outliers functions.  I couldn't find anything in the documentation, and I believe others have had the same problem based on posts on gitter and image.sc. I've tried to add basic instructions (including a GUI workaround for less experienced users, and a mention of the command line call for advanced users).",1

* Update DEEPLABCUT.yaml

Users appear to be grabbing `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` from the repo in order to install `2.2rc3`. Unfortunately, it installs 2.1.10.4, and gets tables from conda rather than pip. Therefore, the instructions elsewhere to install the newest versions of the code with this conda env file are inaccurate. 

To eliminate confusion, the repo version of `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` should be updated to the same as the version on the blog.

On windows 10, I have tried using the existing repo file to install 2.1.10.4, then running `pip install deeplabcut[gui]==2.2rc3`. While it appears to install ok, I get a tables error (seen in #1368 and #1398 ).

One thing I have been confused about since moving to maDLC has been how to extract outlier frames from analyzed video (as was typical in the single animal workflow) to use the refine labels toolbox. I would convert to tracklets, but need better detection before the refine tracklets GUI would work. For example, I could run the refine tracklets GUI, but some points would be non existent so I couldn't refine them. I was stuck just manually extracting frames without the efficiency and power of the extract outliers functions.  I couldn't find anything in the documentation, and I believe others have had the same problem based on posts on gitter and image.sc. I've tried to add basic instructions (including a GUI workaround for less experienced users, and a mention of the command line call for advanced users).",1

* Update DEEPLABCUT.yaml

Users appear to be grabbing `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` from the repo in order to install `2.2rc3`. Unfortunately, it installs 2.1.10.4, and gets tables from conda rather than pip. Therefore, the instructions elsewhere to install the newest versions of the code with this conda env file are inaccurate. 

To eliminate confusion, the repo version of `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` should be updated to the same as the version on the blog.

On windows 10, I have tried using the existing repo file to install 2.1.10.4, then running `pip install deeplabcut[gui]==2.2rc3`. While it appears to install ok, I get a tables error (seen in #1368 and #1398 ).

"Update maDLC_AdvUserGuide.md (#923)

One thing I have been confused about since moving to maDLC has been how to extract outlier frames from analyzed video (as was typical in the single animal workflow) to use the refine labels toolbox. I would convert to tracklets, but need better detection before the refine tracklets GUI would work. For example, I could run the refine tracklets GUI, but some points would be non existent so I couldn't refine them. I was stuck just manually extracting frames without the efficiency and power of the extract outliers functions.  I couldn't find anything in the documentation, and I believe others have had the same problem based on posts on gitter and image.sc. I've tried to add basic instructions (including a GUI workaround for less experienced users, and a mention of the command line call for advanced users).",1

"Update DEEPLABCUT.yaml (#1400)

* Update DEEPLABCUT.yaml

Users appear to be grabbing `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` from the repo in order to install `2.2rc3`. Unfortunately, it installs 2.1.10.4, and gets tables from conda rather than pip. Therefore, the instructions elsewhere to install the newest versions of the code with this conda env file are inaccurate. 

To eliminate confusion, the repo version of `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` should be updated to the same as the version on the blog.

On windows 10, I have tried using the existing repo file to install 2.1.10.4, then running `pip install deeplabcut[gui]==2.2rc3`. While it appears to install ok, I get a tables error (seen in #1368 and #1398 ). Uninstalling pytables with conda and reinstalling with pip works sometimes (#1368), but just now I tested it again and created a tensorflow error.",0

"Update maDLC_AdvUserGuide.md (#923)

One thing I have been confused about since moving to maDLC has been how to extract outlier frames from analyzed video (as was typical in the single animal workflow) to use the refine labels toolbox. I would convert to tracklets, but need better detection before the refine tracklets GUI would work. For example, I could run the refine tracklets GUI, but some points would be non existent so I couldn't refine them. I was stuck just manually extracting frames without the efficiency and power of the extract outliers functions.  I couldn't find anything in the documentation, and I believe others have had the same problem based on posts on gitter and image.sc. I've tried to add basic instructions (including a GUI workaround for less experienced users, and a mention of the command line call for advanced users).",1

* Update DEEPLABCUT.yaml

Users appear to be grabbing `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` from the repo in order to install `2.2rc3`. Unfortunately, it installs 2.1.10.4, and gets tables from conda rather than pip. Therefore, the instructions elsewhere to install the newest versions of the code with this conda env file are inaccurate. 

To eliminate confusion, the repo version of `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` should be updated to the same as the version on the blog.

On windows 10, I have tried using the existing repo file to install 2.1.10.4, then running `pip install deeplabcut[gui]==2.2rc3`. While it appears to install ok, I get a tables error (seen in #1368 and #1398 ).

One thing I have been confused about since moving to maDLC has been how to extract outlier frames from analyzed video (as was typical in the single animal workflow) to use the refine labels toolbox. I would convert to tracklets, but need better detection before the refine tracklets GUI would work. For example, I could run the refine tracklets GUI, but some points would be non existent so I couldn't refine them. I was stuck just manually extracting frames without the efficiency and power of the extract outliers functions.  I couldn't find anything in the documentation, and I believe others have had the same problem based on posts on gitter and image.sc. I've tried to add basic instructions (including a GUI workaround for less experienced users, and a mention of the command line call for advanced users).",1

One thing I have been confused about since moving to maDLC has been how to extract outlier frames from analyzed video (as was typical in the single animal workflow) to use the refine labels toolbox. I would convert to tracklets, but need better detection before the refine tracklets GUI would work. For example, I could run the refine tracklets GUI, but some points would be non existent so I couldn't refine them. I was stuck just manually extracting frames without the efficiency and power of the extract outliers functions.  I couldn't find anything in the documentation, and I believe others have had the same problem based on posts on gitter and image.sc. I've tried to add basic instructions (including a GUI workaround for less experienced users, and a mention of the command line call for advanced users).",1

One thing I have been confused about since moving to maDLC has been how to extract outlier frames from analyzed video (as was typical in the single animal workflow) to use the refine labels toolbox. I would convert to tracklets, but need better detection before the refine tracklets GUI would work. For example, I could run the refine tracklets GUI, but some points would be non existent so I couldn't refine them. I was stuck just manually extracting frames without the efficiency and power of the extract outliers functions.  I couldn't find anything in the documentation, and I believe others have had the same problem based on posts on gitter and image.sc. I've tried to add basic instructions (including a GUI workaround for less experienced users, and a mention of the command line call for advanced users).",1

One thing I have been confused about since moving to maDLC has been how to extract outlier frames from analyzed video (as was typical in the single animal workflow) to use the refine labels toolbox. I would convert to tracklets, but need better detection before the refine tracklets GUI would work. For example, I could run the refine tracklets GUI, but some points would be non existent so I couldn't refine them. I was stuck just manually extracting frames without the efficiency and power of the extract outliers functions.  I couldn't find anything in the documentation, and I believe others have had the same problem based on posts on gitter and image.sc. I've tried to add basic instructions (including a GUI workaround for less experienced users, and a mention of the command line call for advanced users).",1
