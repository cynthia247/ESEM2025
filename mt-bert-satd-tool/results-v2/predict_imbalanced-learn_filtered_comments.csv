Random over-sampling to balance the data set,0
--------------------------------------------,0
,0
Random over-sampling can be used to repeat some samples and balance the,0
number of samples between the dataset. It can be seen that with this trivial,0
approach the boundary decision is already less biased toward the majority,0
class. The class :class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.RandomOverSampler`,0
implements such of a strategy.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"By default, random over-sampling generates a bootstrap. The parameter",0
`shrinkage` allows adding a small perturbation to the generated data,0
to generate a smoothed bootstrap instead. The plot below shows the difference,0
between the two data generation strategies.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
It looks like more samples are generated with smoothed bootstrap. This is due,0
to the fact that the samples generated are not superimposing with the,0
original samples.,0

--------------------------------------------------,0

Instead of repeating the same samples when over-sampling or perturbating the,0
"generated bootstrap samples, one can use some specific heuristic instead.",0
:class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.ADASYN` and,0
:class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.SMOTE` can be used in this case.,0

The following plot illustrates the difference between,0
:class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.ADASYN` and,0

:class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.ADASYN` will focus on the samples which are,0
difficult to classify with a nearest-neighbors rule while regular,0
:class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.SMOTE` will not make any distinction.,0
"Therefore, the decision function depending of the algorithm.",0

"Due to those sampling particularities, it can give rise to some specific",0

SMOTE proposes several variants by identifying specific samples to consider,0
during the resampling. The borderline version,0
(:class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.BorderlineSMOTE`) will detect which point to,0
select which are in the border between two classes. The SVM version,0
(:class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.SVMSMOTE`) will use the support vectors,0
found using an SVM algorithm to create new sample while the KMeans version,0
(:class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.KMeansSMOTE`) will make a clustering before,0

Problem definition,0
------------------,0
,0
We are dropping the following features:,0
,0
"- ""fnlwgt"": this feature was created while studying the ""adult"" dataset.",0
"Thus, we will not use this feature which is not acquired during the survey.",0
"- ""education-num"": it is encoding the same information than ""education"".",0
"Thus, we are removing one of these 2 features.",0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"The ""adult"" dataset as a class ratio of about 3:1",0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
This dataset is only slightly imbalanced. To better highlight the effect of,0
"learning from an imbalanced dataset, we will increase its ratio to 30:1",0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
We will perform a cross-validation evaluation to get an estimate of the test,0
score.,0
,0
"As a baseline, we could use a classifier which will always predict the",0
majority class independently of the features provided.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"Instead of using the accuracy, we can use the balanced accuracy which will",0
take into account the balancing issue.,0
%%,0

Strategies to learn from an imbalanced dataset,0
----------------------------------------------,0
We will use a dictionary and a list to continuously store the results of,0
our experiments and show them as a pandas dataframe.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
Dummy baseline,0
..............,0
,0
"Before to train a real machine learning model, we can store the results",0
obtained with our :class:`~sklearn.dummy.DummyClassifier`.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
Linear classifier baseline,0
..........................,0
,0
We will create a machine learning pipeline using a,0
":class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` classifier. In this regard,",0
we will need to one-hot encode the categorical columns and standardized the,0
numerical columns before to inject the data into the,0
:class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` classifier.,0
,0
"First, we define our numerical and categorical pipelines.",0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"Then, we can create a preprocessor which will dispatch the categorical",0
columns to the categorical pipeline and the numerical columns to the,0
numerical pipeline,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"Finally, we connect our preprocessor with our",0
:class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression`. We can then evaluate our,0
model.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
We can see that our linear model is learning slightly better than our dummy,0
"baseline. However, it is impacted by the class imbalance.",0
,0
We can verify that something similar is happening with a tree-based model,0
such as :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`. With this type of,0
"classifier, we will not need to scale the numerical data, and we will only",0
need to ordinal encode the categorical data.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
The :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier` is as well affected by,0
"the class imbalanced, slightly less than the linear model. Now, we will",0
present different approach to improve the performance of these 2 models.,0
,0
Use `class_weight`,0
..................,0
,0
Most of the models in `scikit-learn` have a parameter `class_weight`. This,0
parameter will affect the computation of the loss in linear model or the,0
criterion in the tree-based model to penalize differently a false,0
classification from the minority and majority class. We can set,0
"`class_weight=""balanced""` such that the weight applied is inversely",0
proportional to the class frequency. We test this parametrization in both,0
linear model and tree-based model.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
We can see that using `class_weight` was really effective for the linear,0
"model, alleviating the issue of learning from imbalanced classes. However,",0
the :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier` is still biased toward,0
"the majority class, mainly due to the criterion which is not suited enough to",0
fight the class imbalance.,0
,0
Resample the training set during learning,0
.........................................,0
,0
Another way is to resample the training set by under-sampling or,0
over-sampling some of the samples. `imbalanced-learn` provides some samplers,0
to do such processing.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
Applying a random under-sampler before the training of the linear model or,0
"random forest, allows to not focus on the majority class at the cost of",0
making more mistake for samples in the majority class (i.e. decreased,0
accuracy).,0
,0
We could apply any type of samplers and find which sampler is working best,0
on the current dataset.,0
,0
"Instead, we will present another way by using classifiers which will apply",0
sampling internally.,0
,0
Use of specific balanced algorithms from imbalanced-learn,0
.........................................................,0
,0
We already showed that random under-sampling can be effective on decision,0
"tree. However, instead of under-sampling once the dataset, one could",0
under-sample the original dataset before to take a bootstrap sample. This is,0
the base of the :class:`imblearn.ensemble.BalancedRandomForestClassifier` and,0
:class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedBaggingClassifier`.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
The performance with the,0
:class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedRandomForestClassifier` is better than,0
applying a single random under-sampling. We will use a gradient-boosting,0
classifier within a :class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedBaggingClassifier`.,0
%% [markdown],0
This last approach is the most effective. The different under-sampling allows,0
to bring some diversity for the different GBDT to learn and not focus on a,0
portion of the majority class.,0

Balancing the class before classification,0
-----------------------------------------,0

"To improve the prediction of the class \#3, it could be interesting to apply",0
"a balancing before to train the naive bayes classifier. Therefore, we will",0
use a :class:`~imblearn.under_sampling.RandomUnderSampler` to equalize the,0
number of samples in all the classes before the training.,0

It is also important to note that we are using the,0
:class:`~imblearn.pipeline.make_pipeline` function implemented in,0
imbalanced-learn to properly handle the samplers.,0

"Although the results are almost identical, it can be seen that the resampling",0

"the other metrics for the other classes. However, the overall results are",0

Random over-sampling to balance the data set,0
--------------------------------------------,0
,0
Random over-sampling can be used to repeat some samples and balance the,0
number of samples between the dataset. It can be seen that with this trivial,0
approach the boundary decision is already less biased toward the majority,0
class. The class :class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.RandomOverSampler`,0
implements such of a strategy.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0

`shrinkage` allows adding a small perturbation to the generated data,0
to generate a smoothed bootstrap instead. The plot below shows the difference,0
between the two data generation strategies.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
It looks like more samples are generated with smoothed bootstrap. This is due,0
to the fact that the samples generated are not superimposing with the,0
original samples.,0

difficult to classify with a nearest-neighbors rule while regular,0

"Therefore, the decision function depending of the algorithm.",0

SMOTE proposes several variants by identifying specific samples to consider,0
during the resampling. The borderline version,0
(:class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.BorderlineSMOTE`) will detect which point to,0
select which are in the border between two classes. The SVM version,0
(:class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.SVMSMOTE`) will use the support vectors,0
found using an SVM algorithm to create new sample while the KMeans version,0

"With the controlled under-sampling methods, the number of samples to be",0

:class:`~imblearn.under_sampling.NearMiss` algorithms implement some,0
heuristic rules in order to select samples. NearMiss-1 selects samples from,0
the majority class for which the average distance of the :math:`k`` nearest,0
samples of the minority class is the smallest. NearMiss-2 selects the samples,0
from the majority class for which the average distance to the farthest,0
samples of the negative class is the smallest. NearMiss-3 is a 2-step,0
"algorithm: first, for each minority sample, their :math:`m`",0

Problem definition,0

We are dropping the following features:,0

"- ""fnlwgt"": this feature was created while studying the ""adult"" dataset.",0
"Thus, we will not use this feature which is not acquired during the survey.",0
"- ""education-num"": it is encoding the same information than ""education"".",0
"Thus, we are removing one of these 2 features.",0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"The ""adult"" dataset as a class ratio of about 3:1",0
%%,0

This dataset is only slightly imbalanced. To better highlight the effect of,0
"learning from an imbalanced dataset, we will increase its ratio to 30:1",0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
We will perform a cross-validation evaluation to get an estimate of the test,0
score.,0

"As a baseline, we could use a classifier which will always predict the",0
majority class independently of the features provided.,0

"Instead of using the accuracy, we can use the balanced accuracy which will",0
take into account the balancing issue.,0

Strategies to learn from an imbalanced dataset,0

We will use a dictionary and a list to continuously store the results of,0
our experiments and show them as a pandas dataframe.,0

Dummy baseline,0

"Before to train a real machine learning model, we can store the results",0
obtained with our :class:`~sklearn.dummy.DummyClassifier`.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
Linear classifier baseline,0
..........................,0
,0
We will create a machine learning pipeline using a,0
":class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` classifier. In this regard,",0
we will need to one-hot encode the categorical columns and standardized the,0
numerical columns before to inject the data into the,0
:class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` classifier.,0
,0
"First, we define our numerical and categorical pipelines.",0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"Then, we can create a preprocessor which will dispatch the categorical",0
columns to the categorical pipeline and the numerical columns to the,0
numerical pipeline,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"Finally, we connect our preprocessor with our",0
:class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression`. We can then evaluate our,0
model.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
We can see that our linear model is learning slightly better than our dummy,0
"baseline. However, it is impacted by the class imbalance.",0
,0
We can verify that something similar is happening with a tree-based model,0
such as :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`. With this type of,0
"classifier, we will not need to scale the numerical data, and we will only",0
need to ordinal encode the categorical data.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
The :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier` is as well affected by,0
"the class imbalanced, slightly less than the linear model. Now, we will",0
present different approach to improve the performance of these 2 models.,0
,0
Use `class_weight`,0
..................,0
,0
Most of the models in `scikit-learn` have a parameter `class_weight`. This,0
parameter will affect the computation of the loss in linear model or the,0
criterion in the tree-based model to penalize differently a false,0
classification from the minority and majority class. We can set,0
"`class_weight=""balanced""` such that the weight applied is inversely",0
proportional to the class frequency. We test this parametrization in both,0
linear model and tree-based model.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
We can see that using `class_weight` was really effective for the linear,0
"model, alleviating the issue of learning from imbalanced classes. However,",0
the :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier` is still biased toward,0
"the majority class, mainly due to the criterion which is not suited enough to",0
fight the class imbalance.,0
,0
Resample the training set during learning,0
.........................................,0
,0
Another way is to resample the training set by under-sampling or,0
over-sampling some of the samples. `imbalanced-learn` provides some samplers,0
to do such processing.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
Applying a random under-sampler before the training of the linear model or,0
"random forest, allows to not focus on the majority class at the cost of",0
making more mistake for samples in the majority class (i.e. decreased,0
accuracy).,0
,0
We could apply any type of samplers and find which sampler is working best,0
on the current dataset.,0
,0
"Instead, we will present another way by using classifiers which will apply",0
sampling internally.,0
,0
Use of specific balanced algorithms from imbalanced-learn,0
.........................................................,0
,0
We already showed that random under-sampling can be effective on decision,0
"tree. However, instead of under-sampling once the dataset, one could",0
under-sample the original dataset before to take a bootstrap sample. This is,0
the base of the :class:`imblearn.ensemble.BalancedRandomForestClassifier` and,0
:class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedBaggingClassifier`.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
The performance with the,0
:class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedRandomForestClassifier` is better than,0
applying a single random under-sampling. We will use a gradient-boosting,0
classifier within a :class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedBaggingClassifier`.,0
%% [markdown],0
This last approach is the most effective. The different under-sampling allows,0
to bring some diversity for the different GBDT to learn and not focus on a,0
portion of the majority class.,0

needs to be added under a TYPE_CHECKING condition like the one done here in,0
_MetadataRequester,0
These methods are a composite of other methods and one cannot set their,0
requests directly. Instead they should be set by setting the requests of the,0
simple methods which make the composite ones.,0
Request values,0
==============,0
"Each request value needs to be one of the following values, or an alias.",0
this is used in `__metadata_request__*` attributes to indicate that a,0
metadata is not present even though it may be present in the,0
corresponding method's signature.,0
"this is used whenever a default value is changed, and therefore the user",0
"should explicitly set the value, otherwise a warning is shown. An example",0
"is when a meta-estimator is only a router, but then becomes also a",0
consumer in a new release.,0
this is the default used in `set_{method}_request` methods to indicate no,0
change requested by the user.,0
item is only an alias if it's a valid identifier,0
Metadata Request for Simple Consumers,0
=====================================,0
This section includes MethodMetadataRequest and MetadataRequest which are,0
used in simple consumers.,0
this is here for us to use this attribute's value instead of doing,0
"`isinstance` in our checks, so that we avoid issues when people vendor",0
this file instead of using it directly from scikit-learn.,0
Called when the default attribute access fails with an AttributeError,0
(either __getattribute__() raises an AttributeError because name is,0
not an instance attribute or an attribute in the class tree for self;,0
or __get__() of a name property raises AttributeError). This method,0
should either return the (computed) attribute value or raise an,0
AttributeError exception.,0
https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getattr__,0
Metadata Request for Routers,0
============================,0
This section includes all objects required for MetadataRouter which is used,0
"in routers, returned by their ``get_metadata_routing``.",0
"This namedtuple is used to store a (mapping, routing) pair. Mapping is a",0
"MethodMapping object, and routing is the output of `get_metadata_routing`.",0
MetadataRouter stores a collection of these namedtuples.,0
A namedtuple storing a single method route. A collection of these namedtuples,0
is stored in a MetadataRouter.,0
this is here for us to use this attribute's value instead of doing,0
"`isinstance`` in our checks, so that we avoid issues when people vendor",0
this file instead of using it directly from scikit-learn.,0
`_self_request` is used if the router is also a consumer.,0
"_self_request, (added using `add_self_request()`) is treated",0
differently from the other objects which are stored in,0
_route_mappings.,0
"conflicts are okay if the passed objects are the same, but it's",0
an issue if they're different objects.,0
doing this instead of a try/except since an AttributeError could be raised,0
for other reasons.,0
Request method,0
==============,0
This section includes what's needed for the request method descriptor and,0
their dynamic generation in a meta class.,0
These strings are used to dynamically generate the docstrings for,0
set_{method}_request methods.,0
we would want to have a method which accepts only the expected args,0
This makes it possible to use the decorated method as an unbound,0
"method, for instance when monkeypatching.",0
https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/28632,0
Replicating python's behavior when positional args are given other,0
"than `self`, and `self` is only allowed if this method is unbound.",0
Now we set the relevant attributes of the function so that it seems,0
"like a normal method to the end user, with known expected arguments.",0
"This code is never run in runtime, but it's here for type checking.",0
Type checkers fail to understand that the `set_{method}_request`,0
"methods are dynamically generated, and they complain that they are",0
not defined. We define them here to make type checkers happy.,0
During type checking analyzers assume this to be True.,0
The following list of defined methods mirrors the list of methods,0
in SIMPLE_METHODS.,0
fmt: off,0
fmt: on,0
"if there are any issues in the default values, it will be raised",0
when ``get_metadata_routing`` is called. Here we are going to,0
ignore all the issues such as bad defaults etc.,0
set ``set_{method}_request``` methods,0
Here we use `isfunction` instead of `ismethod` because calling `getattr`,0
on a class instead of an instance returns an unbound function.,0
"ignore the first parameter of the method, which is usually ""self""",0
Then overwrite those defaults with the ones provided in,0
__metadata_request__* attributes. Defaults set in,0
__metadata_request__* attributes take precedence over signature,0
sniffing.,0
need to go through the MRO since this is a class attribute and,0
``vars`` doesn't report the parent class attributes. We go through,0
the reverse of the MRO so that child classes have precedence over,0
their parents.,0
we don't check for attr.startswith() since python prefixes attrs,0
starting with __ with the `_ClassName`.,0
Process Routing in Routers,0
==========================,0
This is almost always the only method used in routers to process and route,0
given metadata. This is to minimize the boilerplate required in routers.,0
Here the first two arguments are positional only which makes everything,0
passed as keyword argument a metadata. The first two args also have an `_`,0
"prefix to reduce the chances of name collisions with the passed metadata, and",0
"since they're positional only, users will never type those underscores.",0
"If routing is not enabled and kwargs are empty, then we don't have to",0
"try doing any routing, we can simply return a structure which returns",0
an empty dict on routed_params.ANYTHING.ANY_METHOD.,0
mypy: ignore-errors,0
update the docstring of the descriptor,0
"delegate only on instances, not the classes.",0
this is to allow access to the docstrings.,0
This makes it possible to use the decorated method as an,0
"unbound method, for instance when monkeypatching.",0
mypy: ignore-errors,0
Inherits from ValueError and TypeError to keep backward compatibility.,0
We allow parameters to not have a constraint so that third party,0
estimators can inherit from sklearn estimators without having to,0
necessarily use the validation tools.,0
"this constraint is satisfied, no need to check further.",0
"No constraint is satisfied, raise with an informative message.",0
Ignore constraints that we don't want to expose in the error,0
"message, i.e. options that are for internal purpose or not",0
officially supported.,0
The dict of parameter constraints is set as an attribute of the function,0
to make it possible to dynamically introspect the constraints for,0
automatic testing.,0
Map *args/**kwargs to the function signature,0
ignore self/cls and positional/keyword markers,0
"When the function is just a wrapper around an estimator, we allow",0
"the function to delegate validation to the estimator, but we",0
replace the name of the estimator by the name of the function in,0
the error message to avoid confusion.,0
better repr if the bounds were given as integers,0
we use an interval of Real to ignore np.nan that has its own,0
constraint,0
"There's no integer outside (-inf, +inf)",0
"bounds are -inf, +inf",0
"interval is [-inf, +inf]",0
special case for ndarray since it can't be instantiated without,0
arguments,0
special case for Integral and Real since they are abstract classes,0

Random over-sampling to balance the data set,0
--------------------------------------------,0
,0
Random over-sampling can be used to repeat some samples and balance the,0
number of samples between the dataset. It can be seen that with this trivial,0
approach the boundary decision is already less biased toward the majority,0
class. The class :class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.RandomOverSampler`,0
implements such of a strategy.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"By default, random over-sampling generates a bootstrap. The parameter",0
`shrinkage` allows adding a small perturbation to the generated data,0
to generate a smoothed bootstrap instead. The plot below shows the difference,0
between the two data generation strategies.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
It looks like more samples are generated with smoothed bootstrap. This is due,0
to the fact that the samples generated are not superimposing with the,0
original samples.,0

More advanced over-sampling using ADASYN and SMOTE,0
--------------------------------------------------,0

Instead of repeating the same samples when over-sampling or perturbating the,0
"generated bootstrap samples, one can use some specific heuristic instead.",0
:class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.ADASYN` and,0
:class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.SMOTE` can be used in this case.,0

difficult to classify with a nearest-neighbors rule while regular,0

SMOTE proposes several variants by identifying specific samples to consider,0
during the resampling. The borderline version,0
(:class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.BorderlineSMOTE`) will detect which point to,0
select which are in the border between two classes. The SVM version,0
(:class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.SVMSMOTE`) will use the support vectors,0
found using an SVM algorithm to create new sample while the KMeans version,0

Linear classifier baseline,0
..........................,0
,0
We will create a machine learning pipeline using a,0
":class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` classifier. In this regard,",0
we will need to one-hot encode the categorical columns and standardized the,0
numerical columns before to inject the data into the,0
:class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` classifier.,0
,0
"First, we define our numerical and categorical pipelines.",0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"Then, we can create a preprocessor which will dispatch the categorical",0
columns to the categorical pipeline and the numerical columns to the,0
numerical pipeline,0
%%,0

"Finally, we connect our preprocessor with our",0
:class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression`. We can then evaluate our,0
model.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
We can see that our linear model is learning slightly better than our dummy,0
"baseline. However, it is impacted by the class imbalance.",0
,0
We can verify that something similar is happening with a tree-based model,0
such as :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`. With this type of,0
"classifier, we will not need to scale the numerical data, and we will only",0
need to ordinal encode the categorical data.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
The :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier` is as well affected by,0
"the class imbalanced, slightly less than the linear model. Now, we will",0
present different approach to improve the performance of these 2 models.,0
,0
Use `class_weight`,0
..................,0
,0
Most of the models in `scikit-learn` have a parameter `class_weight`. This,0
parameter will affect the computation of the loss in linear model or the,0
criterion in the tree-based model to penalize differently a false,0
classification from the minority and majority class. We can set,0
"`class_weight=""balanced""` such that the weight applied is inversely",0
proportional to the class frequency. We test this parametrization in both,0
linear model and tree-based model.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
We can see that using `class_weight` was really effective for the linear,0
"model, alleviating the issue of learning from imbalanced classes. However,",0
the :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier` is still biased toward,0
"the majority class, mainly due to the criterion which is not suited enough to",0
fight the class imbalance.,0
,0
Resample the training set during learning,0
.........................................,0
,0
Another way is to resample the training set by under-sampling or,0
over-sampling some of the samples. `imbalanced-learn` provides some samplers,0
to do such processing.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
Applying a random under-sampler before the training of the linear model or,0
"random forest, allows to not focus on the majority class at the cost of",0
making more mistake for samples in the majority class (i.e. decreased,0
accuracy).,0
,0
We could apply any type of samplers and find which sampler is working best,0
on the current dataset.,0
,0
"Instead, we will present another way by using classifiers which will apply",0
sampling internally.,0
,0
Use of specific balanced algorithms from imbalanced-learn,0
.........................................................,0
,0
We already showed that random under-sampling can be effective on decision,0
"tree. However, instead of under-sampling once the dataset, one could",0
under-sample the original dataset before to take a bootstrap sample. This is,0
the base of the :class:`imblearn.ensemble.BalancedRandomForestClassifier` and,0
:class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedBaggingClassifier`.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
The performance with the,0
:class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedRandomForestClassifier` is better than,0
applying a single random under-sampling. We will use a gradient-boosting,0
classifier within a :class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedBaggingClassifier`.,0
%% [markdown],0
This last approach is the most effective. The different under-sampling allows,0
to bring some diversity for the different GBDT to learn and not focus on a,0
portion of the majority class.,0

Using ``sampling_strategy`` in resampling algorithms,0
====================================================,0
,0
`sampling_strategy` as a `float`,0
--------------------------------,0

`sampling_strategy` can be given a `float`. For **under-sampling,0
"methods**, it corresponds to the ratio :math:`\alpha_{us}` defined by",0
:math:`N_{rM} = \alpha_{us} \times N_{m}` where :math:`N_{rM}` and,0
:math:`N_{m}` are the number of samples in the majority class after,0

minority class after resampling and the number of samples in the majority,0
"class, respectively.",0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
`sampling_strategy` as a `str`,0
-------------------------------,0
,0
`sampling_strategy` can be given as a string which specify the class,0
"targeted by the resampling. With under- and over-sampling, the number of",0
samples will be equalized.,0

"With **cleaning method**, the number of samples in each class will not be",0
equalized even if targeted.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
`sampling_strategy` as a `dict`,0
-------------------------------,0
,0
"When `sampling_strategy` is a `dict`, the keys correspond to the targeted",0
classes. The values correspond to the desired number of samples for each,0
targeted class. This is working for both **under- and over-sampling**,0
algorithms but not for the **cleaning algorithms**. Use a `list` instead.,0

Only the following methods are supported in the routing mechanism. Adding new,0
methods at the moment involves monkeypatching this list.,0
"Note that if this list is changed or monkeypatched, the corresponding method",0
needs to be added under a TYPE_CHECKING condition like the one done here in,0
_MetadataRequester,0
These methods are a composite of other methods and one cannot set their,0
requests directly. Instead they should be set by setting the requests of the,0
simple methods which make the composite ones.,0
Request values,0
==============,0
"Each request value needs to be one of the following values, or an alias.",0
this is used in `__metadata_request__*` attributes to indicate that a,0
metadata is not present even though it may be present in the,0
corresponding method's signature.,0
"this is used whenever a default value is changed, and therefore the user",0
"should explicitly set the value, otherwise a warning is shown. An example",0
"is when a meta-estimator is only a router, but then becomes also a",0
consumer in a new release.,0
this is the default used in `set_{method}_request` methods to indicate no,0
change requested by the user.,0
item is only an alias if it's a valid identifier,0
Metadata Request for Simple Consumers,0
=====================================,0
This section includes MethodMetadataRequest and MetadataRequest which are,0
used in simple consumers.,0
this is here for us to use this attribute's value instead of doing,0
"`isinstance` in our checks, so that we avoid issues when people vendor",0
this file instead of using it directly from scikit-learn.,0
Called when the default attribute access fails with an AttributeError,0
(either __getattribute__() raises an AttributeError because name is,0
not an instance attribute or an attribute in the class tree for self;,0
or __get__() of a name property raises AttributeError). This method,0
should either return the (computed) attribute value or raise an,0
AttributeError exception.,0
https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getattr__,0
Metadata Request for Routers,0
============================,0
This section includes all objects required for MetadataRouter which is used,0
"in routers, returned by their ``get_metadata_routing``.",0
"This namedtuple is used to store a (mapping, routing) pair. Mapping is a",0
"MethodMapping object, and routing is the output of `get_metadata_routing`.",0
MetadataRouter stores a collection of these namedtuples.,0
A namedtuple storing a single method route. A collection of these namedtuples,0
is stored in a MetadataRouter.,0
this is here for us to use this attribute's value instead of doing,0
"`isinstance`` in our checks, so that we avoid issues when people vendor",0
this file instead of using it directly from scikit-learn.,0
`_self_request` is used if the router is also a consumer.,0
"_self_request, (added using `add_self_request()`) is treated",0
differently from the other objects which are stored in,0
_route_mappings.,0
"conflicts are okay if the passed objects are the same, but it's",0
an issue if they're different objects.,0
doing this instead of a try/except since an AttributeError could be raised,0
for other reasons.,0
Request method,0
==============,0
This section includes what's needed for the request method descriptor and,0
their dynamic generation in a meta class.,0
These strings are used to dynamically generate the docstrings for,0
set_{method}_request methods.,0
we would want to have a method which accepts only the expected args,0
This makes it possible to use the decorated method as an unbound,0
"method, for instance when monkeypatching.",0
https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/28632,0
Replicating python's behavior when positional args are given other,0
"than `self`, and `self` is only allowed if this method is unbound.",0
Now we set the relevant attributes of the function so that it seems,0
"like a normal method to the end user, with known expected arguments.",0
"This code is never run in runtime, but it's here for type checking.",0
Type checkers fail to understand that the `set_{method}_request`,0
"methods are dynamically generated, and they complain that they are",0
not defined. We define them here to make type checkers happy.,0
During type checking analyzers assume this to be True.,0
The following list of defined methods mirrors the list of methods,0
in SIMPLE_METHODS.,0
fmt: off,0
fmt: on,0
"if there are any issues in the default values, it will be raised",0
when ``get_metadata_routing`` is called. Here we are going to,0
ignore all the issues such as bad defaults etc.,0
set ``set_{method}_request``` methods,0
Here we use `isfunction` instead of `ismethod` because calling `getattr`,0
on a class instead of an instance returns an unbound function.,0
"ignore the first parameter of the method, which is usually ""self""",0
Then overwrite those defaults with the ones provided in,0
__metadata_request__* attributes. Defaults set in,0
__metadata_request__* attributes take precedence over signature,0
sniffing.,0
need to go through the MRO since this is a class attribute and,0
``vars`` doesn't report the parent class attributes. We go through,0
the reverse of the MRO so that child classes have precedence over,0
their parents.,0
we don't check for attr.startswith() since python prefixes attrs,0
starting with __ with the `_ClassName`.,0
Process Routing in Routers,0
==========================,0
This is almost always the only method used in routers to process and route,0
given metadata. This is to minimize the boilerplate required in routers.,0
Here the first two arguments are positional only which makes everything,0
passed as keyword argument a metadata. The first two args also have an `_`,0
"prefix to reduce the chances of name collisions with the passed metadata, and",0
"since they're positional only, users will never type those underscores.",0
"If routing is not enabled and kwargs are empty, then we don't have to",0
"try doing any routing, we can simply return a structure which returns",0
an empty dict on routed_params.ANYTHING.ANY_METHOD.,0
mypy: ignore-errors,0
update the docstring of the descriptor,0
"delegate only on instances, not the classes.",0
this is to allow access to the docstrings.,0
This makes it possible to use the decorated method as an,0
"unbound method, for instance when monkeypatching.",0
mypy: ignore-errors,0
Inherits from ValueError and TypeError to keep backward compatibility.,0
We allow parameters to not have a constraint so that third party,0
estimators can inherit from sklearn estimators without having to,0
necessarily use the validation tools.,0
"this constraint is satisfied, no need to check further.",0
"No constraint is satisfied, raise with an informative message.",0
Ignore constraints that we don't want to expose in the error,0
"message, i.e. options that are for internal purpose or not",0
officially supported.,0
The dict of parameter constraints is set as an attribute of the function,0
to make it possible to dynamically introspect the constraints for,0
automatic testing.,0
Map *args/**kwargs to the function signature,0
ignore self/cls and positional/keyword markers,0
"When the function is just a wrapper around an estimator, we allow",0
"the function to delegate validation to the estimator, but we",0
replace the name of the estimator by the name of the function in,0
the error message to avoid confusion.,0
better repr if the bounds were given as integers,0
we use an interval of Real to ignore np.nan that has its own,0
constraint,0
"There's no integer outside (-inf, +inf)",0
"bounds are -inf, +inf",0
"interval is [-inf, +inf]",0

Random over-sampling to balance the data set,0
--------------------------------------------,0
,0
Random over-sampling can be used to repeat some samples and balance the,0
number of samples between the dataset. It can be seen that with this trivial,0
approach the boundary decision is already less biased toward the majority,0
class. The class :class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.RandomOverSampler`,0
implements such of a strategy.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"By default, random over-sampling generates a bootstrap. The parameter",0
`shrinkage` allows adding a small perturbation to the generated data,0
to generate a smoothed bootstrap instead. The plot below shows the difference,0
between the two data generation strategies.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
It looks like more samples are generated with smoothed bootstrap. This is due,0
to the fact that the samples generated are not superimposing with the,0
original samples.,0

Instead of repeating the same samples when over-sampling or perturbating the,0

:class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.ADASYN` and,0

:class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.ADASYN` will focus on the samples which are,0
difficult to classify with a nearest-neighbors rule while regular,0
:class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.SMOTE` will not make any distinction.,0
"Therefore, the decision function depending of the algorithm.",0

"Due to those sampling particularities, it can give rise to some specific",0

SMOTE proposes several variants by identifying specific samples to consider,0
during the resampling. The borderline version,0
(:class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.BorderlineSMOTE`) will detect which point to,0
select which are in the border between two classes. The SVM version,0
(:class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.SVMSMOTE`) will use the support vectors,0
found using an SVM algorithm to create new sample while the KMeans version,0

Prototype selection: under-sampling by selecting existing samples,0

The algorithm performing prototype selection can be subdivided into two,0
groups: (i) the controlled under-sampling methods and (ii) the cleaning,0
under-sampling methods.,0

"With the controlled under-sampling methods, the number of samples to be",0
selected can be specified.,0
:class:`~imblearn.under_sampling.RandomUnderSampler` is the most naive way of,0
performing such selection by randomly selecting a given number of samples by,0
the targeted class.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
:class:`~imblearn.under_sampling.NearMiss` algorithms implement some,0
heuristic rules in order to select samples. NearMiss-1 selects samples from,0
the majority class for which the average distance of the :math:`k`` nearest,0
samples of the minority class is the smallest. NearMiss-2 selects the samples,0
from the majority class for which the average distance to the farthest,0
samples of the negative class is the smallest. NearMiss-3 is a 2-step,0
"algorithm: first, for each minority sample, their :math:`m`",0
"nearest-neighbors will be kept; then, the majority samples selected are the",0
on for which the average distance to the :math:`k` nearest neighbors is the,0
largest.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
:class:`~imblearn.under_sampling.EditedNearestNeighbours` removes samples of,0
the majority class for which their class differ from the one of their,0
nearest-neighbors. This sieve can be repeated which is the principle of the,0
:class:`~imblearn.under_sampling.RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbours`.,0
:class:`~imblearn.under_sampling.AllKNN` is slightly different from the,0
:class:`~imblearn.under_sampling.RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbours` by changing,0
"the :math:`k` parameter of the internal nearest neighors algorithm,",0
increasing it at each iteration.,0

:class:`~imblearn.under_sampling.CondensedNearestNeighbour` makes use of a,0
1-NN to iteratively decide if a sample should be kept in a dataset or not.,0
The issue is that :class:`~imblearn.under_sampling.CondensedNearestNeighbour`,0
is sensitive to noise by preserving the noisy samples.,0
:class:`~imblearn.under_sampling.OneSidedSelection` also used the 1-NN and,0
use :class:`~imblearn.under_sampling.TomekLinks` to remove the samples,0
considered noisy. The,0
:class:`~imblearn.under_sampling.NeighbourhoodCleaningRule` use a,0

Problem definition,0

We are dropping the following features:,0
,0
"- ""fnlwgt"": this feature was created while studying the ""adult"" dataset.",0
"Thus, we will not use this feature which is not acquired during the survey.",0
"- ""education-num"": it is encoding the same information than ""education"".",0
"Thus, we are removing one of these 2 features.",0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"The ""adult"" dataset as a class ratio of about 3:1",0
%%,0

This dataset is only slightly imbalanced. To better highlight the effect of,0
"learning from an imbalanced dataset, we will increase its ratio to 30:1",0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
We will perform a cross-validation evaluation to get an estimate of the test,0
score.,0

"As a baseline, we could use a classifier which will always predict the",0
majority class independently of the features provided.,0

take into account the balancing issue.,0

Strategies to learn from an imbalanced dataset,0

our experiments and show them as a pandas dataframe.,0

obtained with our :class:`~sklearn.dummy.DummyClassifier`.,0

%% [markdown],0
Linear classifier baseline,0
..........................,0
,0
We will create a machine learning pipeline using a,0
":class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` classifier. In this regard,",0
we will need to one-hot encode the categorical columns and standardized the,0
numerical columns before to inject the data into the,0
:class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` classifier.,0
,0
"First, we define our numerical and categorical pipelines.",0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"Then, we can create a preprocessor which will dispatch the categorical",0
columns to the categorical pipeline and the numerical columns to the,0
numerical pipeline,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"Finally, we connect our preprocessor with our",0
:class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression`. We can then evaluate our,0
model.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
We can see that our linear model is learning slightly better than our dummy,0
"baseline. However, it is impacted by the class imbalance.",0
,0
We can verify that something similar is happening with a tree-based model,0
such as :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`. With this type of,0
"classifier, we will not need to scale the numerical data, and we will only",0
need to ordinal encode the categorical data.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
The :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier` is as well affected by,0
"the class imbalanced, slightly less than the linear model. Now, we will",0
present different approach to improve the performance of these 2 models.,0
,0
Use `class_weight`,0
..................,0
,0
Most of the models in `scikit-learn` have a parameter `class_weight`. This,0
parameter will affect the computation of the loss in linear model or the,0
criterion in the tree-based model to penalize differently a false,0
classification from the minority and majority class. We can set,0
"`class_weight=""balanced""` such that the weight applied is inversely",0
proportional to the class frequency. We test this parametrization in both,0
linear model and tree-based model.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
We can see that using `class_weight` was really effective for the linear,0
"model, alleviating the issue of learning from imbalanced classes. However,",0
the :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier` is still biased toward,0
"the majority class, mainly due to the criterion which is not suited enough to",0
fight the class imbalance.,0
,0
Resample the training set during learning,0
.........................................,0
,0
Another way is to resample the training set by under-sampling or,0
over-sampling some of the samples. `imbalanced-learn` provides some samplers,0
to do such processing.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
Applying a random under-sampler before the training of the linear model or,0
"random forest, allows to not focus on the majority class at the cost of",0
making more mistake for samples in the majority class (i.e. decreased,0
accuracy).,0
,0
We could apply any type of samplers and find which sampler is working best,0
on the current dataset.,0
,0
"Instead, we will present another way by using classifiers which will apply",0
sampling internally.,0
,0
Use of specific balanced algorithms from imbalanced-learn,0
.........................................................,0
,0
We already showed that random under-sampling can be effective on decision,0
"tree. However, instead of under-sampling once the dataset, one could",0
under-sample the original dataset before to take a bootstrap sample. This is,0
the base of the :class:`imblearn.ensemble.BalancedRandomForestClassifier` and,0
:class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedBaggingClassifier`.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
The performance with the,0
:class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedRandomForestClassifier` is better than,0
applying a single random under-sampling. We will use a gradient-boosting,0
classifier within a :class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedBaggingClassifier`.,0
%% [markdown],0
This last approach is the most effective. The different under-sampling allows,0
to bring some diversity for the different GBDT to learn and not focus on a,0
portion of the majority class.,0

Metadata Request for Simple Consumers,0
=====================================,0
This section includes MethodMetadataRequest and MetadataRequest which are,0
used in simple consumers.,0
this is here for us to use this attribute's value instead of doing,0
"`isinstance` in our checks, so that we avoid issues when people vendor",0
this file instead of using it directly from scikit-learn.,0
Called when the default attribute access fails with an AttributeError,0
(either __getattribute__() raises an AttributeError because name is,0
not an instance attribute or an attribute in the class tree for self;,0
or __get__() of a name property raises AttributeError). This method,0
should either return the (computed) attribute value or raise an,0
AttributeError exception.,0
https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getattr__,0
Metadata Request for Routers,0
============================,0
This section includes all objects required for MetadataRouter which is used,0
"in routers, returned by their ``get_metadata_routing``.",0
"This namedtuple is used to store a (mapping, routing) pair. Mapping is a",0
"MethodMapping object, and routing is the output of `get_metadata_routing`.",0
MetadataRouter stores a collection of these namedtuples.,0
A namedtuple storing a single method route. A collection of these namedtuples,0
is stored in a MetadataRouter.,0
this is here for us to use this attribute's value instead of doing,0
"`isinstance`` in our checks, so that we avoid issues when people vendor",0
this file instead of using it directly from scikit-learn.,0
`_self_request` is used if the router is also a consumer.,0
"_self_request, (added using `add_self_request()`) is treated",0
differently from the other objects which are stored in,0
_route_mappings.,0
"conflicts are okay if the passed objects are the same, but it's",0
an issue if they're different objects.,0
doing this instead of a try/except since an AttributeError could be raised,0
for other reasons.,0
Request method,0
==============,0
This section includes what's needed for the request method descriptor and,0
their dynamic generation in a meta class.,0
These strings are used to dynamically generate the docstrings for,0
set_{method}_request methods.,0
we would want to have a method which accepts only the expected args,0
Now we set the relevant attributes of the function so that it seems,0
"like a normal method to the end user, with known expected arguments.",0
"This code is never run in runtime, but it's here for type checking.",0
Type checkers fail to understand that the `set_{method}_request`,0
"methods are dynamically generated, and they complain that they are",0
not defined. We define them here to make type checkers happy.,0
During type checking analyzers assume this to be True.,0
The following list of defined methods mirrors the list of methods,0
in SIMPLE_METHODS.,0
fmt: off,0
fmt: on,0
"if there are any issues in the default values, it will be raised",0
when ``get_metadata_routing`` is called. Here we are going to,0
ignore all the issues such as bad defaults etc.,0
set ``set_{method}_request``` methods,0
Here we use `isfunction` instead of `ismethod` because calling `getattr`,0
on a class instead of an instance returns an unbound function.,0
"ignore the first parameter of the method, which is usually ""self""",0
Then overwrite those defaults with the ones provided in,0
__metadata_request__* attributes. Defaults set in,0
__metadata_request__* attributes take precedence over signature,0
sniffing.,0
need to go through the MRO since this is a class attribute and,0
``vars`` doesn't report the parent class attributes. We go through,0
the reverse of the MRO so that child classes have precedence over,0
their parents.,0
we don't check for attr.startswith() since python prefixes attrs,0
starting with __ with the `_ClassName`.,0
Process Routing in Routers,0
==========================,0
This is almost always the only method used in routers to process and route,0
given metadata. This is to minimize the boilerplate required in routers.,0
Here the first two arguments are positional only which makes everything,0
passed as keyword argument a metadata. The first two args also have an `_`,0
"prefix to reduce the chances of name collisions with the passed metadata, and",0
"since they're positional only, users will never type those underscores.",0
"If routing is not enabled and kwargs are empty, then we don't have to",0
"try doing any routing, we can simply return a structure which returns",0
an empty dict on routed_params.ANYTHING.ANY_METHOD.,0
mypy: ignore-errors,0
update the docstring of the descriptor,0
"delegate only on instances, not the classes.",0
this is to allow access to the docstrings.,0
This makes it possible to use the decorated method as an,0
"unbound method, for instance when monkeypatching.",0
mypy: ignore-errors,0
Inherits from ValueError and TypeError to keep backward compatibility.,0
We allow parameters to not have a constraint so that third party,0
estimators can inherit from sklearn estimators without having to,0
necessarily use the validation tools.,0
"this constraint is satisfied, no need to check further.",0
"No constraint is satisfied, raise with an informative message.",0
Ignore constraints that we don't want to expose in the error,0
"message, i.e. options that are for internal purpose or not",0
officially supported.,0
The dict of parameter constraints is set as an attribute of the function,0
to make it possible to dynamically introspect the constraints for,0
automatic testing.,0
Map *args/**kwargs to the function signature,0
ignore self/cls and positional/keyword markers,0
"When the function is just a wrapper around an estimator, we allow",0
"the function to delegate validation to the estimator, but we",0
replace the name of the estimator by the name of the function in,0
the error message to avoid confusion.,0
better repr if the bounds were given as integers,0
we use an interval of Real to ignore np.nan that has its own,0
constraint,0
"There's no integer outside (-inf, +inf)",0
"bounds are -inf, +inf",0
"interval is [-inf, +inf]",0
special case for ndarray since it can't be instantiated without,0
arguments,0
special case for Integral and Real since they are abstract classes,0

Random over-sampling to balance the data set,0
--------------------------------------------,0
,0
Random over-sampling can be used to repeat some samples and balance the,0
number of samples between the dataset. It can be seen that with this trivial,0
approach the boundary decision is already less biased toward the majority,0
class. The class :class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.RandomOverSampler`,0
implements such of a strategy.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"By default, random over-sampling generates a bootstrap. The parameter",0
`shrinkage` allows adding a small perturbation to the generated data,0
to generate a smoothed bootstrap instead. The plot below shows the difference,0
between the two data generation strategies.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
It looks like more samples are generated with smoothed bootstrap. This is due,0
to the fact that the samples generated are not superimposing with the,0
original samples.,0

..........................,0

We will create a machine learning pipeline using a,0
":class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` classifier. In this regard,",0
we will need to one-hot encode the categorical columns and standardized the,0
numerical columns before to inject the data into the,0
:class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` classifier.,0
,0
"First, we define our numerical and categorical pipelines.",0

%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
We can see that our linear model is learning slightly better than our dummy,0
"baseline. However, it is impacted by the class imbalance.",0

We can verify that something similar is happening with a tree-based model,0
such as :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`. With this type of,0
"classifier, we will not need to scale the numerical data, and we will only",0
need to ordinal encode the categorical data.,0

The :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier` is as well affected by,0
"the class imbalanced, slightly less than the linear model. Now, we will",0
present different approach to improve the performance of these 2 models.,0
,0
Use `class_weight`,0
..................,0
,0
Most of the models in `scikit-learn` have a parameter `class_weight`. This,0
parameter will affect the computation of the loss in linear model or the,0
criterion in the tree-based model to penalize differently a false,0
classification from the minority and majority class. We can set,0
"`class_weight=""balanced""` such that the weight applied is inversely",0
proportional to the class frequency. We test this parametrization in both,0
linear model and tree-based model.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
We can see that using `class_weight` was really effective for the linear,0
"model, alleviating the issue of learning from imbalanced classes. However,",0
the :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier` is still biased toward,0
"the majority class, mainly due to the criterion which is not suited enough to",0
fight the class imbalance.,0
,0
Resample the training set during learning,0
.........................................,0
,0
Another way is to resample the training set by under-sampling or,0
over-sampling some of the samples. `imbalanced-learn` provides some samplers,0
to do such processing.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
Applying a random under-sampler before the training of the linear model or,0
"random forest, allows to not focus on the majority class at the cost of",0
making more mistake for samples in the majority class (i.e. decreased,0
accuracy).,0
,0
We could apply any type of samplers and find which sampler is working best,0
on the current dataset.,0
,0
"Instead, we will present another way by using classifiers which will apply",0
sampling internally.,0

Use of specific balanced algorithms from imbalanced-learn,0
.........................................................,0

We already showed that random under-sampling can be effective on decision,0
"tree. However, instead of under-sampling once the dataset, one could",0
under-sample the original dataset before to take a bootstrap sample. This is,0
the base of the :class:`imblearn.ensemble.BalancedRandomForestClassifier` and,0
:class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedBaggingClassifier`.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
The performance with the,0
:class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedRandomForestClassifier` is better than,0
applying a single random under-sampling. We will use a gradient-boosting,0
classifier within a :class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedBaggingClassifier`.,0

This last approach is the most effective. The different under-sampling allows,0
to bring some diversity for the different GBDT to learn and not focus on a,0

Setting the data set,0

We use a part of the 20 newsgroups data set by loading 4 topics. Using the,0
"scikit-learn loader, the data are split into a training and a testing set.",0

Balancing the class before classification,0
-----------------------------------------,0
,0
"To improve the prediction of the class \#3, it could be interesting to apply",0
"a balancing before to train the naive bayes classifier. Therefore, we will",0
use a :class:`~imblearn.under_sampling.RandomUnderSampler` to equalize the,0
number of samples in all the classes before the training.,0

It is also important to note that we are using the,0
:class:`~imblearn.pipeline.make_pipeline` function implemented in,0
imbalanced-learn to properly handle the samplers.,0

"Although the results are almost identical, it can be seen that the resampling",0
allowed to correct the poor recall of the class \#3 at the cost of reducing,0
"the other metrics for the other classes. However, the overall results are",0
slightly better.,0

Using ``sampling_strategy`` in resampling algorithms,0
====================================================,0
,0
`sampling_strategy` as a `float`,0
--------------------------------,0
,0
`sampling_strategy` can be given a `float`. For **under-sampling,0
"methods**, it corresponds to the ratio :math:`\alpha_{us}` defined by",0
:math:`N_{rM} = \alpha_{us} \times N_{m}` where :math:`N_{rM}` and,0
:math:`N_{m}` are the number of samples in the majority class after,0
"resampling and the number of samples in the minority class, respectively.",0
%%,0

:math:`\alpha_{os}` defined by :math:`N_{rm} = \alpha_{os} \times N_{M}`,0
where :math:`N_{rm}` and :math:`N_{M}` are the number of samples in the,0
minority class after resampling and the number of samples in the majority,0
"class, respectively.",0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
`sampling_strategy` as a `str`,0
-------------------------------,0
,0
`sampling_strategy` can be given as a string which specify the class,0
"targeted by the resampling. With under- and over-sampling, the number of",0
samples will be equalized.,0
,0
Note that we are using multiple classes from now on.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"With **cleaning method**, the number of samples in each class will not be",0
equalized even if targeted.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
`sampling_strategy` as a `dict`,0
------------------------------,0
,0
"When `sampling_strategy` is a `dict`, the keys correspond to the targeted",0
classes. The values correspond to the desired number of samples for each,0
targeted class. This is working for both **under- and over-sampling**,0
algorithms but not for the **cleaning algorithms**. Use a `list` instead.,0

Only the following methods are supported in the routing mechanism. Adding new,0
methods at the moment involves monkeypatching this list.,0
"Note that if this list is changed or monkeypatched, the corresponding method",0
needs to be added under a TYPE_CHECKING condition like the one done here in,0
_MetadataRequester,0
These methods are a composite of other methods and one cannot set their,0
requests directly. Instead they should be set by setting the requests of the,0
simple methods which make the composite ones.,0
Request values,0
==============,0
"Each request value needs to be one of the following values, or an alias.",0
this is used in `__metadata_request__*` attributes to indicate that a,0
metadata is not present even though it may be present in the,0
corresponding method's signature.,0
"this is used whenever a default value is changed, and therefore the user",0
"should explicitly set the value, otherwise a warning is shown. An example",0
"is when a meta-estimator is only a router, but then becomes also a",0
consumer in a new release.,0
this is the default used in `set_{method}_request` methods to indicate no,0
change requested by the user.,0
item is only an alias if it's a valid identifier,0
Metadata Request for Simple Consumers,0
=====================================,0
This section includes MethodMetadataRequest and MetadataRequest which are,0
used in simple consumers.,0
this is here for us to use this attribute's value instead of doing,0
"`isinstance` in our checks, so that we avoid issues when people vendor",0
this file instead of using it directly from scikit-learn.,0
Called when the default attribute access fails with an AttributeError,0
(either __getattribute__() raises an AttributeError because name is,0
not an instance attribute or an attribute in the class tree for self;,0
or __get__() of a name property raises AttributeError). This method,0
should either return the (computed) attribute value or raise an,0
AttributeError exception.,0
https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getattr__,0
Metadata Request for Routers,0
============================,0
This section includes all objects required for MetadataRouter which is used,0
"in routers, returned by their ``get_metadata_routing``.",0
"This namedtuple is used to store a (mapping, routing) pair. Mapping is a",0
"MethodMapping object, and routing is the output of `get_metadata_routing`.",0
MetadataRouter stores a collection of these namedtuples.,0
A namedtuple storing a single method route. A collection of these namedtuples,0
is stored in a MetadataRouter.,0
this is here for us to use this attribute's value instead of doing,0
"`isinstance`` in our checks, so that we avoid issues when people vendor",0
this file instead of using it directly from scikit-learn.,0
`_self_request` is used if the router is also a consumer.,0
"_self_request, (added using `add_self_request()`) is treated",0
differently from the other objects which are stored in,0
_route_mappings.,0
"conflicts are okay if the passed objects are the same, but it's",0
an issue if they're different objects.,0
doing this instead of a try/except since an AttributeError could be raised,0
for other reasons.,0
Request method,0
==============,0
This section includes what's needed for the request method descriptor and,0
their dynamic generation in a meta class.,0
These strings are used to dynamically generate the docstrings for,0
set_{method}_request methods.,0
we would want to have a method which accepts only the expected args,0
Now we set the relevant attributes of the function so that it seems,0
"like a normal method to the end user, with known expected arguments.",0
"This code is never run in runtime, but it's here for type checking.",0
Type checkers fail to understand that the `set_{method}_request`,0
"methods are dynamically generated, and they complain that they are",0
not defined. We define them here to make type checkers happy.,0
During type checking analyzers assume this to be True.,0
The following list of defined methods mirrors the list of methods,0
in SIMPLE_METHODS.,0
fmt: off,0
fmt: on,0
"if there are any issues in the default values, it will be raised",0
when ``get_metadata_routing`` is called. Here we are going to,0
ignore all the issues such as bad defaults etc.,0
set ``set_{method}_request``` methods,0
Here we use `isfunction` instead of `ismethod` because calling `getattr`,0
on a class instead of an instance returns an unbound function.,0
"ignore the first parameter of the method, which is usually ""self""",0
Then overwrite those defaults with the ones provided in,0
__metadata_request__* attributes. Defaults set in,0
__metadata_request__* attributes take precedence over signature,0
sniffing.,0
need to go through the MRO since this is a class attribute and,0
``vars`` doesn't report the parent class attributes. We go through,0
the reverse of the MRO so that child classes have precedence over,0
their parents.,0
we don't check for attr.startswith() since python prefixes attrs,0
starting with __ with the `_ClassName`.,0
Process Routing in Routers,0
==========================,0
This is almost always the only method used in routers to process and route,0
given metadata. This is to minimize the boilerplate required in routers.,0
Here the first two arguments are positional only which makes everything,0
passed as keyword argument a metadata. The first two args also have an `_`,0
"prefix to reduce the chances of name collisions with the passed metadata, and",0
"since they're positional only, users will never type those underscores.",0
"If routing is not enabled and kwargs are empty, then we don't have to",0
"try doing any routing, we can simply return a structure which returns",0
an empty dict on routed_params.ANYTHING.ANY_METHOD.,0
mypy: ignore-errors,0
update the docstring of the descriptor,0
"delegate only on instances, not the classes.",0
this is to allow access to the docstrings.,0
This makes it possible to use the decorated method as an,0
"unbound method, for instance when monkeypatching.",0
mypy: ignore-errors,0
Inherits from ValueError and TypeError to keep backward compatibility.,0
We allow parameters to not have a constraint so that third party,0
estimators can inherit from sklearn estimators without having to,0
necessarily use the validation tools.,0
"this constraint is satisfied, no need to check further.",0
"No constraint is satisfied, raise with an informative message.",0
Ignore constraints that we don't want to expose in the error,0
"message, i.e. options that are for internal purpose or not",0
officially supported.,0
The dict of parameter constraints is set as an attribute of the function,0
to make it possible to dynamically introspect the constraints for,0
automatic testing.,0
Map *args/**kwargs to the function signature,0
ignore self/cls and positional/keyword markers,0
"When the function is just a wrapper around an estimator, we allow",0
"the function to delegate validation to the estimator, but we",0
replace the name of the estimator by the name of the function in,0
the error message to avoid confusion.,0
better repr if the bounds were given as integers,0

"bounds are -inf, +inf",0
"interval is [-inf, +inf]",0

Random over-sampling to balance the data set,0
--------------------------------------------,0
,0
Random over-sampling can be used to repeat some samples and balance the,0
number of samples between the dataset. It can be seen that with this trivial,0
approach the boundary decision is already less biased toward the majority,0
class. The class :class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.RandomOverSampler`,0
implements such of a strategy.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"By default, random over-sampling generates a bootstrap. The parameter",0
`shrinkage` allows adding a small perturbation to the generated data,0
to generate a smoothed bootstrap instead. The plot below shows the difference,0
between the two data generation strategies.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
It looks like more samples are generated with smoothed bootstrap. This is due,0
to the fact that the samples generated are not superimposing with the,0
original samples.,0

Instead of repeating the same samples when over-sampling or perturbating the,0

:class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.SMOTE` can be used in this case.,0

:class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.ADASYN` and,0

:class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.ADASYN` will focus on the samples which are,0
difficult to classify with a nearest-neighbors rule while regular,0

"Therefore, the decision function depending of the algorithm.",0

"Due to those sampling particularities, it can give rise to some specific",0

SMOTE proposes several variants by identifying specific samples to consider,0
during the resampling. The borderline version,0
(:class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.BorderlineSMOTE`) will detect which point to,0
select which are in the border between two classes. The SVM version,0
(:class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.SVMSMOTE`) will use the support vectors,0
found using an SVM algorithm to create new sample while the KMeans version,0

"- ""fnlwgt"": this feature was created while studying the ""adult"" dataset.",0
"Thus, we will not use this feature which is not acquired during the survey.",0
"- ""education-num"": it is encoding the same information than ""education"".",0
"Thus, we are removing one of these 2 features.",0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"The ""adult"" dataset as a class ratio of about 3:1",0
%%,0

This dataset is only slightly imbalanced. To better highlight the effect of,0
"learning from an imbalanced dataset, we will increase its ratio to 30:1",0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
We will perform a cross-validation evaluation to get an estimate of the test,0
score.,0

"As a baseline, we could use a classifier which will always predict the",0
majority class independently of the features provided.,0

take into account the balancing issue.,0

Strategies to learn from an imbalanced dataset,0

We will use a dictionary and a list to continuously store the results of,0
our experiments and show them as a pandas dataframe.,0

obtained with our :class:`~sklearn.dummy.DummyClassifier`.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
Linear classifier baseline,0
..........................,0
,0
We will create a machine learning pipeline using a,0
":class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` classifier. In this regard,",0
we will need to one-hot encode the categorical columns and standardized the,0
numerical columns before to inject the data into the,0
:class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` classifier.,0
,0
"First, we define our numerical and categorical pipelines.",0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"Then, we can create a preprocessor which will dispatch the categorical",0
columns to the categorical pipeline and the numerical columns to the,0
numerical pipeline,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"Finally, we connect our preprocessor with our",0
:class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression`. We can then evaluate our,0
model.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
We can see that our linear model is learning slightly better than our dummy,0
"baseline. However, it is impacted by the class imbalance.",0
,0
We can verify that something similar is happening with a tree-based model,0
such as :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`. With this type of,0
"classifier, we will not need to scale the numerical data, and we will only",0
need to ordinal encode the categorical data.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
The :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier` is as well affected by,0
"the class imbalanced, slightly less than the linear model. Now, we will",0
present different approach to improve the performance of these 2 models.,0
,0
Use `class_weight`,0
..................,0
,0
Most of the models in `scikit-learn` have a parameter `class_weight`. This,0
parameter will affect the computation of the loss in linear model or the,0
criterion in the tree-based model to penalize differently a false,0
classification from the minority and majority class. We can set,0
"`class_weight=""balanced""` such that the weight applied is inversely",0
proportional to the class frequency. We test this parametrization in both,0
linear model and tree-based model.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
We can see that using `class_weight` was really effective for the linear,0
"model, alleviating the issue of learning from imbalanced classes. However,",0
the :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier` is still biased toward,0
"the majority class, mainly due to the criterion which is not suited enough to",0
fight the class imbalance.,0
,0
Resample the training set during learning,0
.........................................,0
,0
Another way is to resample the training set by under-sampling or,0
over-sampling some of the samples. `imbalanced-learn` provides some samplers,0
to do such processing.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
Applying a random under-sampler before the training of the linear model or,0
"random forest, allows to not focus on the majority class at the cost of",0
making more mistake for samples in the majority class (i.e. decreased,0
accuracy).,0
,0
We could apply any type of samplers and find which sampler is working best,0
on the current dataset.,0
,0
"Instead, we will present another way by using classifiers which will apply",0
sampling internally.,0
,0
Use of specific balanced algorithms from imbalanced-learn,0
.........................................................,0
,0
We already showed that random under-sampling can be effective on decision,0
"tree. However, instead of under-sampling once the dataset, one could",0
under-sample the original dataset before to take a bootstrap sample. This is,0
the base of the :class:`imblearn.ensemble.BalancedRandomForestClassifier` and,0
:class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedBaggingClassifier`.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
The performance with the,0
:class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedRandomForestClassifier` is better than,0
applying a single random under-sampling. We will use a gradient-boosting,0
classifier within a :class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedBaggingClassifier`.,0
%% [markdown],0
This last approach is the most effective. The different under-sampling allows,0
to bring some diversity for the different GBDT to learn and not focus on a,0
portion of the majority class.,0

Metadata Request for Routers,0
============================,0
This section includes all objects required for MetadataRouter which is used,0
"in routers, returned by their ``get_metadata_routing``.",0
"This namedtuple is used to store a (mapping, routing) pair. Mapping is a",0
"MethodMapping object, and routing is the output of `get_metadata_routing`.",0
MetadataRouter stores a collection of these namedtuples.,0
A namedtuple storing a single method route. A collection of these namedtuples,0
is stored in a MetadataRouter.,0
this is here for us to use this attribute's value instead of doing,0
"`isinstance`` in our checks, so that we avoid issues when people vendor",0
this file instead of using it directly from scikit-learn.,0
`_self_request` is used if the router is also a consumer.,0
"_self_request, (added using `add_self_request()`) is treated",0
differently from the other objects which are stored in,0
_route_mappings.,0
"conflicts are okay if the passed objects are the same, but it's",0
an issue if they're different objects.,0
doing this instead of a try/except since an AttributeError could be raised,0
for other reasons.,0
Request method,0
==============,0
This section includes what's needed for the request method descriptor and,0
their dynamic generation in a meta class.,0
These strings are used to dynamically generate the docstrings for,0
set_{method}_request methods.,0
we would want to have a method which accepts only the expected args,0
Now we set the relevant attributes of the function so that it seems,0
"like a normal method to the end user, with known expected arguments.",0
"This code is never run in runtime, but it's here for type checking.",0
Type checkers fail to understand that the `set_{method}_request`,0
"methods are dynamically generated, and they complain that they are",0
not defined. We define them here to make type checkers happy.,0
During type checking analyzers assume this to be True.,0
The following list of defined methods mirrors the list of methods,0
in SIMPLE_METHODS.,0
fmt: off,0
fmt: on,0
"if there are any issues in the default values, it will be raised",0
when ``get_metadata_routing`` is called. Here we are going to,0
ignore all the issues such as bad defaults etc.,0
set ``set_{method}_request``` methods,0
Here we use `isfunction` instead of `ismethod` because calling `getattr`,0
on a class instead of an instance returns an unbound function.,0
"ignore the first parameter of the method, which is usually ""self""",0
Then overwrite those defaults with the ones provided in,0
__metadata_request__* attributes. Defaults set in,0
__metadata_request__* attributes take precedence over signature,0
sniffing.,0
need to go through the MRO since this is a class attribute and,0
``vars`` doesn't report the parent class attributes. We go through,0
the reverse of the MRO so that child classes have precedence over,0
their parents.,0
we don't check for attr.startswith() since python prefixes attrs,0
starting with __ with the `_ClassName`.,0
Process Routing in Routers,0
==========================,0
This is almost always the only method used in routers to process and route,0
given metadata. This is to minimize the boilerplate required in routers.,0
Here the first two arguments are positional only which makes everything,0
passed as keyword argument a metadata. The first two args also have an `_`,0
"prefix to reduce the chances of name collisions with the passed metadata, and",0
"since they're positional only, users will never type those underscores.",0
"If routing is not enabled and kwargs are empty, then we don't have to",0
"try doing any routing, we can simply return a structure which returns",0
an empty dict on routed_params.ANYTHING.ANY_METHOD.,0
mypy: ignore-errors,0
update the docstring of the descriptor,0
"delegate only on instances, not the classes.",0
this is to allow access to the docstrings.,0
This makes it possible to use the decorated method as an,0
"unbound method, for instance when monkeypatching.",0
mypy: ignore-errors,0
Inherits from ValueError and TypeError to keep backward compatibility.,0
We allow parameters to not have a constraint so that third party,0
estimators can inherit from sklearn estimators without having to,0
necessarily use the validation tools.,0
"this constraint is satisfied, no need to check further.",0
"No constraint is satisfied, raise with an informative message.",0
Ignore constraints that we don't want to expose in the error,0
"message, i.e. options that are for internal purpose or not",0
officially supported.,0
The dict of parameter constraints is set as an attribute of the function,0
to make it possible to dynamically introspect the constraints for,0
automatic testing.,0
Map *args/**kwargs to the function signature,0
ignore self/cls and positional/keyword markers,0
"When the function is just a wrapper around an estimator, we allow",0
"the function to delegate validation to the estimator, but we",0
replace the name of the estimator by the name of the function in,0
the error message to avoid confusion.,0
better repr if the bounds were given as integers,0
we use an interval of Real to ignore np.nan that has its own,0
constraint,0
"There's no integer outside (-inf, +inf)",0
"bounds are -inf, +inf",0
"interval is [-inf, +inf]",0
special case for ndarray since it can't be instantiated without,0
arguments,0
special case for Integral and Real since they are abstract classes,0

Linear classifier baseline,0
..........................,0
,0
We will create a machine learning pipeline using a,0
":class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` classifier. In this regard,",0
we will need to one-hot encode the categorical columns and standardized the,0
numerical columns before to inject the data into the,0
:class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` classifier.,0
,0
"First, we define our numerical and categorical pipelines.",0

model.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
We can see that our linear model is learning slightly better than our dummy,0
"baseline. However, it is impacted by the class imbalance.",0

We can verify that something similar is happening with a tree-based model,0
such as :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`. With this type of,0
"classifier, we will not need to scale the numerical data, and we will only",0
need to ordinal encode the categorical data.,0
%%,0

The :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier` is as well affected by,0
"the class imbalanced, slightly less than the linear model. Now, we will",0
present different approach to improve the performance of these 2 models.,0
,0
Use `class_weight`,0
..................,0
,0
Most of the models in `scikit-learn` have a parameter `class_weight`. This,0
parameter will affect the computation of the loss in linear model or the,0
criterion in the tree-based model to penalize differently a false,0
classification from the minority and majority class. We can set,0
"`class_weight=""balanced""` such that the weight applied is inversely",0
proportional to the class frequency. We test this parametrization in both,0
linear model and tree-based model.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
We can see that using `class_weight` was really effective for the linear,0
"model, alleviating the issue of learning from imbalanced classes. However,",0
the :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier` is still biased toward,0
"the majority class, mainly due to the criterion which is not suited enough to",0
fight the class imbalance.,0
,0
Resample the training set during learning,0
.........................................,0
,0
Another way is to resample the training set by under-sampling or,0
over-sampling some of the samples. `imbalanced-learn` provides some samplers,0
to do such processing.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
Applying a random under-sampler before the training of the linear model or,0
"random forest, allows to not focus on the majority class at the cost of",0
making more mistake for samples in the majority class (i.e. decreased,0
accuracy).,0
,0
We could apply any type of samplers and find which sampler is working best,0
on the current dataset.,0
,0
"Instead, we will present another way by using classifiers which will apply",0
sampling internally.,0
,0
Use of specific balanced algorithms from imbalanced-learn,0
.........................................................,0
,0
We already showed that random under-sampling can be effective on decision,0
"tree. However, instead of under-sampling once the dataset, one could",0
under-sample the original dataset before to take a bootstrap sample. This is,0
the base of the :class:`imblearn.ensemble.BalancedRandomForestClassifier` and,0
:class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedBaggingClassifier`.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
The performance with the,0
:class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedRandomForestClassifier` is better than,0
applying a single random under-sampling. We will use a gradient-boosting,0
classifier within a :class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedBaggingClassifier`.,0
%% [markdown],0
This last approach is the most effective. The different under-sampling allows,0
to bring some diversity for the different GBDT to learn and not focus on a,0

Setting the data set,0
--------------------,0
,0
We use a part of the 20 newsgroups data set by loading 4 topics. Using the,0
"scikit-learn loader, the data are split into a training and a testing set.",0
,0
Note the class \#3 is the minority class and has almost twice less samples,0
than the majority class.,0

The usual scikit-learn pipeline,0
-------------------------------,0
,0
You might usually use scikit-learn pipeline by combining the TF-IDF,0
vectorizer to feed a multinomial naive bayes classifier. A classification,0
report summarized the results on the testing set.,0
,0
"As expected, the recall of the class \#3 is low mainly due to the class",0
imbalanced.,0
%%,0

%% [markdown],0
Balancing the class before classification,0
-----------------------------------------,0
,0
"To improve the prediction of the class \#3, it could be interesting to apply",0
"a balancing before to train the naive bayes classifier. Therefore, we will",0
use a :class:`~imblearn.under_sampling.RandomUnderSampler` to equalize the,0
number of samples in all the classes before the training.,0
,0
It is also important to note that we are using the,0
:class:`~imblearn.pipeline.make_pipeline` function implemented in,0
imbalanced-learn to properly handle the samplers.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"Although the results are almost identical, it can be seen that the resampling",0
allowed to correct the poor recall of the class \#3 at the cost of reducing,0
"the other metrics for the other classes. However, the overall results are",0
slightly better.,0

Using ``sampling_strategy`` in resampling algorithms,0
====================================================,0
,0
`sampling_strategy` as a `float`,0
--------------------------------,0
,0
`sampling_strategy` can be given a `float`. For **under-sampling,0
"methods**, it corresponds to the ratio :math:`\alpha_{us}` defined by",0
:math:`N_{rM} = \alpha_{us} \times N_{m}` where :math:`N_{rM}` and,0
:math:`N_{m}` are the number of samples in the majority class after,0
"resampling and the number of samples in the minority class, respectively.",0
%%,0
select only 2 classes since the ratio make sense in this case,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"For **over-sampling methods**, it correspond to the ratio",0
:math:`\alpha_{os}` defined by :math:`N_{rm} = \alpha_{os} \times N_{M}`,0
where :math:`N_{rm}` and :math:`N_{M}` are the number of samples in the,0
minority class after resampling and the number of samples in the majority,0
"class, respectively.",0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
`sampling_strategy` as a `str`,0
-------------------------------,0
,0
`sampling_strategy` can be given as a string which specify the class,0
"targeted by the resampling. With under- and over-sampling, the number of",0
samples will be equalized.,0
,0
Note that we are using multiple classes from now on.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"With **cleaning method**, the number of samples in each class will not be",0
equalized even if targeted.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
`sampling_strategy` as a `dict`,0
------------------------------,0
,0
"When `sampling_strategy` is a `dict`, the keys correspond to the targeted",0
classes. The values correspond to the desired number of samples for each,0
targeted class. This is working for both **under- and over-sampling**,0
algorithms but not for the **cleaning algorithms**. Use a `list` instead.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
`sampling_strategy` as a `list`,0

,0
"When `sampling_strategy` is a `list`, the list contains the targeted",0
classes. It is used only for **cleaning methods** and raise an error,0
otherwise.,0

number of samples for each class.,0

Random over-sampling to balance the data set,0
--------------------------------------------,0
,0
Random over-sampling can be used to repeat some samples and balance the,0
number of samples between the dataset. It can be seen that with this trivial,0
approach the boundary decision is already less biased toward the majority,0
class. The class :class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.RandomOverSampler`,0
implements such of a strategy.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"By default, random over-sampling generates a bootstrap. The parameter",0
`shrinkage` allows adding a small perturbation to the generated data,0
to generate a smoothed bootstrap instead. The plot below shows the difference,0
between the two data generation strategies.,0
%%,0

It looks like more samples are generated with smoothed bootstrap. This is due,0
to the fact that the samples generated are not superimposing with the,0
original samples.,0

We can see that our linear model is learning slightly better than our dummy,0
"baseline. However, it is impacted by the class imbalance.",0
,0
We can verify that something similar is happening with a tree-based model,0
such as :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`. With this type of,0
"classifier, we will not need to scale the numerical data, and we will only",0
need to ordinal encode the categorical data.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
The :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier` is as well affected by,0
"the class imbalanced, slightly less than the linear model. Now, we will",0
present different approach to improve the performance of these 2 models.,0
,0
Use `class_weight`,0
..................,0
,0
Most of the models in `scikit-learn` have a parameter `class_weight`. This,0
parameter will affect the computation of the loss in linear model or the,0
criterion in the tree-based model to penalize differently a false,0
classification from the minority and majority class. We can set,0
"`class_weight=""balanced""` such that the weight applied is inversely",0
proportional to the class frequency. We test this parametrization in both,0
linear model and tree-based model.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
We can see that using `class_weight` was really effective for the linear,0
"model, alleviating the issue of learning from imbalanced classes. However,",0
the :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier` is still biased toward,0
"the majority class, mainly due to the criterion which is not suited enough to",0
fight the class imbalance.,0
,0
Resample the training set during learning,0
.........................................,0
,0
Another way is to resample the training set by under-sampling or,0
over-sampling some of the samples. `imbalanced-learn` provides some samplers,0
to do such processing.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
Applying a random under-sampler before the training of the linear model or,0
"random forest, allows to not focus on the majority class at the cost of",0
making more mistake for samples in the majority class (i.e. decreased,0
accuracy).,0
,0
We could apply any type of samplers and find which sampler is working best,0
on the current dataset.,0
,0
"Instead, we will present another way by using classifiers which will apply",0
sampling internally.,0
,0
Use of specific balanced algorithms from imbalanced-learn,0
.........................................................,0
,0
We already showed that random under-sampling can be effective on decision,0
"tree. However, instead of under-sampling once the dataset, one could",0
under-sample the original dataset before to take a bootstrap sample. This is,0
the base of the :class:`imblearn.ensemble.BalancedRandomForestClassifier` and,0
:class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedBaggingClassifier`.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
The performance with the,0
:class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedRandomForestClassifier` is better than,0
applying a single random under-sampling. We will use a gradient-boosting,0
classifier within a :class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedBaggingClassifier`.,0
%% [markdown],0
This last approach is the most effective. The different under-sampling allows,0
to bring some diversity for the different GBDT to learn and not focus on a,0
portion of the majority class.,0

The usual scikit-learn pipeline,0

vectorizer to feed a multinomial naive bayes classifier. A classification,0

Balancing the class before classification,0
-----------------------------------------,0
,0
"To improve the prediction of the class \#3, it could be interesting to apply",0
"a balancing before to train the naive bayes classifier. Therefore, we will",0
use a :class:`~imblearn.under_sampling.RandomUnderSampler` to equalize the,0
number of samples in all the classes before the training.,0

It is also important to note that we are using the,0
:class:`~imblearn.pipeline.make_pipeline` function implemented in,0
imbalanced-learn to properly handle the samplers.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"Although the results are almost identical, it can be seen that the resampling",0
allowed to correct the poor recall of the class \#3 at the cost of reducing,0
"the other metrics for the other classes. However, the overall results are",0
slightly better.,0

`sampling_strategy` can be given as a string which specify the class,0

Random over-sampling to balance the data set,0
--------------------------------------------,0
,0
Random over-sampling can be used to repeat some samples and balance the,0
number of samples between the dataset. It can be seen that with this trivial,0
approach the boundary decision is already less biased toward the majority,0
class. The class :class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.RandomOverSampler`,0
implements such of a strategy.,0
%%,0

"By default, random over-sampling generates a bootstrap. The parameter",0
`shrinkage` allows adding a small perturbation to the generated data,0
to generate a smoothed bootstrap instead. The plot below shows the difference,0
between the two data generation strategies.,0
%%,0

It looks like more samples are generated with smoothed bootstrap. This is due,0
to the fact that the samples generated are not superimposing with the,0
original samples.,0

Problem definition,0
------------------,0
,0
We are dropping the following features:,0
,0
"- ""fnlwgt"": this feature was created while studying the ""adult"" dataset.",0
"Thus, we will not use this feature which is not acquired during the survey.",0
"- ""education-num"": it is encoding the same information than ""education"".",0
"Thus, we are removing one of these 2 features.",0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"The ""adult"" dataset as a class ratio of about 3:1",0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
This dataset is only slightly imbalanced. To better highlight the effect of,0
"learning from an imbalanced dataset, we will increase its ratio to 30:1",0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
We will perform a cross-validation evaluation to get an estimate of the test,0
score.,0
,0
"As a baseline, we could use a classifier which will always predict the",0
majority class independently of the features provided.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"Instead of using the accuracy, we can use the balanced accuracy which will",0
take into account the balancing issue.,0

Strategies to learn from an imbalanced dataset,0
----------------------------------------------,0
We will use a dictionary and a list to continuously store the results of,0
our experiments and show them as a pandas dataframe.,0
%%,0

Dummy baseline,0
..............,0
,0
"Before to train a real machine learning model, we can store the results",0
obtained with our :class:`~sklearn.dummy.DummyClassifier`.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
Linear classifier baseline,0
..........................,0
,0
We will create a machine learning pipeline using a,0
":class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` classifier. In this regard,",0
we will need to one-hot encode the categorical columns and standardized the,0
numerical columns before to inject the data into the,0
:class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` classifier.,0
,0
"First, we define our numerical and categorical pipelines.",0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"Then, we can create a preprocessor which will dispatch the categorical",0
columns to the categorical pipeline and the numerical columns to the,0
numerical pipeline,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"Finally, we connect our preprocessor with our",0
:class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression`. We can then evaluate our,0
model.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
We can see that our linear model is learning slightly better than our dummy,0
"baseline. However, it is impacted by the class imbalance.",0
,0
We can verify that something similar is happening with a tree-based model,0
such as :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`. With this type of,0
"classifier, we will not need to scale the numerical data, and we will only",0
need to ordinal encode the categorical data.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
The :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier` is as well affected by,0
"the class imbalanced, slightly less than the linear model. Now, we will",0
present different approach to improve the performance of these 2 models.,0
,0
Use `class_weight`,0
..................,0
,0
Most of the models in `scikit-learn` have a parameter `class_weight`. This,0
parameter will affect the computation of the loss in linear model or the,0
criterion in the tree-based model to penalize differently a false,0
classification from the minority and majority class. We can set,0
"`class_weight=""balanced""` such that the weight applied is inversely",0
proportional to the class frequency. We test this parametrization in both,0
linear model and tree-based model.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
We can see that using `class_weight` was really effective for the linear,0
"model, alleviating the issue of learning from imbalanced classes. However,",0
the :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier` is still biased toward,0
"the majority class, mainly due to the criterion which is not suited enough to",0
fight the class imbalance.,0
,0
Resample the training set during learning,0
.........................................,0
,0
Another way is to resample the training set by under-sampling or,0
over-sampling some of the samples. `imbalanced-learn` provides some samplers,0
to do such processing.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
Applying a random under-sampler before the training of the linear model or,0
"random forest, allows to not focus on the majority class at the cost of",0
making more mistake for samples in the majority class (i.e. decreased,0
accuracy).,0
,0
We could apply any type of samplers and find which sampler is working best,0
on the current dataset.,0
,0
"Instead, we will present another way by using classifiers which will apply",0
sampling internally.,0
,0
Use of specific balanced algorithms from imbalanced-learn,0
.........................................................,0
,0
We already showed that random under-sampling can be effective on decision,0
"tree. However, instead of under-sampling once the dataset, one could",0
under-sample the original dataset before to take a bootstrap sample. This is,0
the base of the :class:`imblearn.ensemble.BalancedRandomForestClassifier` and,0
:class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedBaggingClassifier`.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
The performance with the,0
:class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedRandomForestClassifier` is better than,0
applying a single random under-sampling. We will use a gradient-boosting,0
classifier within a :class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedBaggingClassifier`.,0
%% [markdown],0
This last approach is the most effective. The different under-sampling allows,0
to bring some diversity for the different GBDT to learn and not focus on a,0
portion of the majority class.,0

"To improve the prediction of the class \#3, it could be interesting to apply",0

use a :class:`~imblearn.under_sampling.RandomUnderSampler` to equalize the,0
number of samples in all the classes before the training.,0

:class:`~imblearn.pipeline.make_pipeline` function implemented in,0
imbalanced-learn to properly handle the samplers.,0

`sampling_strategy` can be given as a string which specify the class,0

Random over-sampling to balance the data set,0
--------------------------------------------,0
,0
Random over-sampling can be used to repeat some samples and balance the,0
number of samples between the dataset. It can be seen that with this trivial,0
approach the boundary decision is already less biased toward the majority,0
class. The class :class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.RandomOverSampler`,0
implements such of a strategy.,0
%%,0

`shrinkage` allows adding a small perturbation to the generated data,0
to generate a smoothed bootstrap instead. The plot below shows the difference,0
between the two data generation strategies.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
It looks like more samples are generated with smoothed bootstrap. This is due,0
to the fact that the samples generated are not superimposing with the,0
original samples.,0

:class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.SMOTE` can be used in this case.,0

:class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.ADASYN` and,0

difficult to classify with a nearest-neighbors rule while regular,0

SMOTE proposes several variants by identifying specific samples to consider,0
during the resampling. The borderline version,0
(:class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.BorderlineSMOTE`) will detect which point to,0
select which are in the border between two classes. The SVM version,0
(:class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.SVMSMOTE`) will use the support vectors,0
found using an SVM algorithm to create new sample while the KMeans version,0

We are dropping the following features:,0
,0
"- ""fnlwgt"": this feature was created while studying the ""adult"" dataset.",0
"Thus, we will not use this feature which is not acquired during the survey.",0
"- ""education-num"": it is encoding the same information than ""education"".",0
"Thus, we are removing one of these 2 features.",0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"The ""adult"" dataset as a class ratio of about 3:1",0
%%,0

This dataset is only slightly imbalanced. To better highlight the effect of,0
"learning from an imbalanced dataset, we will increase its ratio to 30:1",0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
We will perform a cross-validation evaluation to get an estimate of the test,0
score.,0

"As a baseline, we could use a classifier which will always predict the",0
majority class independently of the features provided.,0

"Instead of using the accuracy, we can use the balanced accuracy which will",0
take into account the balancing issue.,0

Strategies to learn from an imbalanced dataset,0
----------------------------------------------,0
We will use a dictionary and a list to continuously store the results of,0
our experiments and show them as a pandas dataframe.,0
%%,0

Dummy baseline,0
..............,0

"Before to train a real machine learning model, we can store the results",0
obtained with our :class:`~sklearn.dummy.DummyClassifier`.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
Linear classifier baseline,0
..........................,0
,0
We will create a machine learning pipeline using a,0
":class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` classifier. In this regard,",0
we will need to one-hot encode the categorical columns and standardized the,0
numerical columns before to inject the data into the,0
:class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` classifier.,0
,0
"First, we define our numerical and categorical pipelines.",0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"Then, we can create a preprocessor which will dispatch the categorical",0
columns to the categorical pipeline and the numerical columns to the,0
numerical pipeline,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"Finally, we connect our preprocessor with our",0
:class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression`. We can then evaluate our,0
model.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
We can see that our linear model is learning slightly better than our dummy,0
"baseline. However, it is impacted by the class imbalance.",0
,0
We can verify that something similar is happening with a tree-based model,0
such as :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`. With this type of,0
"classifier, we will not need to scale the numerical data, and we will only",0
need to ordinal encode the categorical data.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
The :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier` is as well affected by,0
"the class imbalanced, slightly less than the linear model. Now, we will",0
present different approach to improve the performance of these 2 models.,0
,0
Use `class_weight`,0
..................,0
,0
Most of the models in `scikit-learn` have a parameter `class_weight`. This,0
parameter will affect the computation of the loss in linear model or the,0
criterion in the tree-based model to penalize differently a false,0
classification from the minority and majority class. We can set,0
"`class_weight=""balanced""` such that the weight applied is inversely",0
proportional to the class frequency. We test this parametrization in both,0
linear model and tree-based model.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
We can see that using `class_weight` was really effective for the linear,0
"model, alleviating the issue of learning from imbalanced classes. However,",0
the :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier` is still biased toward,0
"the majority class, mainly due to the criterion which is not suited enough to",0
fight the class imbalance.,0
,0
Resample the training set during learning,0
.........................................,0
,0
Another way is to resample the training set by under-sampling or,0
over-sampling some of the samples. `imbalanced-learn` provides some samplers,0
to do such processing.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
Applying a random under-sampler before the training of the linear model or,0
"random forest, allows to not focus on the majority class at the cost of",0
making more mistake for samples in the majority class (i.e. decreased,0
accuracy).,0
,0
We could apply any type of samplers and find which sampler is working best,0
on the current dataset.,0
,0
"Instead, we will present another way by using classifiers which will apply",0
sampling internally.,0
,0
Use of specific balanced algorithms from imbalanced-learn,0
.........................................................,0
,0
We already showed that random under-sampling can be effective on decision,0
"tree. However, instead of under-sampling once the dataset, one could",0
under-sample the original dataset before to take a bootstrap sample. This is,0
the base of the :class:`imblearn.ensemble.BalancedRandomForestClassifier` and,0
:class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedBaggingClassifier`.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
The performance with the,0
:class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedRandomForestClassifier` is better than,0
applying a single random under-sampling. We will use a gradient-boosting,0
classifier within a :class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedBaggingClassifier`.,0
%% [markdown],0
This last approach is the most effective. The different under-sampling allows,0
to bring some diversity for the different GBDT to learn and not focus on a,0
portion of the majority class.,0

Random over-sampling to balance the data set,0
--------------------------------------------,0
,0
Random over-sampling can be used to repeat some samples and balance the,0
number of samples between the dataset. It can be seen that with this trivial,0
approach the boundary decision is already less biased toward the majority,0
class. The class :class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.RandomOverSampler`,0
implements such of a strategy.,0
%%,0

`shrinkage` allows adding a small perturbation to the generated data,0
to generate a smoothed bootstrap instead. The plot below shows the difference,0
between the two data generation strategies.,0

It looks like more samples are generated with smoothed bootstrap. This is due,0
to the fact that the samples generated are not superimposing with the,0
original samples.,0

Problem definition,0
------------------,0
,0
We are dropping the following features:,0
,0
"- ""fnlwgt"": this feature was created while studying the ""adult"" dataset.",0
"Thus, we will not use this feature which is not acquired during the survey.",0
"- ""education-num"": it is encoding the same information than ""education"".",0
"Thus, we are removing one of these 2 features.",0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"The ""adult"" dataset as a class ratio of about 3:1",0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
This dataset is only slightly imbalanced. To better highlight the effect of,0
"learning from an imbalanced dataset, we will increase its ratio to 30:1",0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
We will perform a cross-validation evaluation to get an estimate of the test,0
score.,0
,0
"As a baseline, we could use a classifier which will always predict the",0
majority class independently of the features provided.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"Instead of using the accuracy, we can use the balanced accuracy which will",0
take into account the balancing issue.,0

Strategies to learn from an imbalanced dataset,0
----------------------------------------------,0
We will use a dictionary and a list to continuously store the results of,0
our experiments and show them as a pandas dataframe.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
Dummy baseline,0
..............,0
,0
"Before to train a real machine learning model, we can store the results",0
obtained with our :class:`~sklearn.dummy.DummyClassifier`.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
Linear classifier baseline,0
..........................,0
,0
We will create a machine learning pipeline using a,0
":class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` classifier. In this regard,",0
we will need to one-hot encode the categorical columns and standardized the,0
numerical columns before to inject the data into the,0
:class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` classifier.,0
,0
"First, we define our numerical and categorical pipelines.",0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"Then, we can create a preprocessor which will dispatch the categorical",0
columns to the categorical pipeline and the numerical columns to the,0
numerical pipeline,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"Finally, we connect our preprocessor with our",0
:class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression`. We can then evaluate our,0
model.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
We can see that our linear model is learning slightly better than our dummy,0
"baseline. However, it is impacted by the class imbalance.",0
,0
We can verify that something similar is happening with a tree-based model,0
such as :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`. With this type of,0
"classifier, we will not need to scale the numerical data, and we will only",0
need to ordinal encode the categorical data.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
The :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier` is as well affected by,0
"the class imbalanced, slightly less than the linear model. Now, we will",0
present different approach to improve the performance of these 2 models.,0
,0
Use `class_weight`,0
..................,0
,0
Most of the models in `scikit-learn` have a parameter `class_weight`. This,0
parameter will affect the computation of the loss in linear model or the,0
criterion in the tree-based model to penalize differently a false,0
classification from the minority and majority class. We can set,0
"`class_weight=""balanced""` such that the weight applied is inversely",0
proportional to the class frequency. We test this parametrization in both,0
linear model and tree-based model.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
We can see that using `class_weight` was really effective for the linear,0
"model, alleviating the issue of learning from imbalanced classes. However,",0
the :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier` is still biased toward,0
"the majority class, mainly due to the criterion which is not suited enough to",0
fight the class imbalance.,0
,0
Resample the training set during learning,0
.........................................,0
,0
Another way is to resample the training set by under-sampling or,0
over-sampling some of the samples. `imbalanced-learn` provides some samplers,0
to do such processing.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
Applying a random under-sampler before the training of the linear model or,0
"random forest, allows to not focus on the majority class at the cost of",0
making more mistake for samples in the majority class (i.e. decreased,0
accuracy).,0
,0
We could apply any type of samplers and find which sampler is working best,0
on the current dataset.,0
,0
"Instead, we will present another way by using classifiers which will apply",0
sampling internally.,0
,0
Use of specific balanced algorithms from imbalanced-learn,0
.........................................................,0
,0
We already showed that random under-sampling can be effective on decision,0
"tree. However, instead of under-sampling once the dataset, one could",0
under-sample the original dataset before to take a bootstrap sample. This is,0
the base of the :class:`imblearn.ensemble.BalancedRandomForestClassifier` and,0
:class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedBaggingClassifier`.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
The performance with the,0
:class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedRandomForestClassifier` is better than,0
applying a single random under-sampling. We will use a gradient-boosting,0
classifier within a :class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedBaggingClassifier`.,0
%% [markdown],0
This last approach is the most effective. The different under-sampling allows,0
to bring some diversity for the different GBDT to learn and not focus on a,0
portion of the majority class.,0

Random over-sampling to balance the data set,0
--------------------------------------------,0
,0
Random over-sampling can be used to repeat some samples and balance the,0
number of samples between the dataset. It can be seen that with this trivial,0
approach the boundary decision is already less biased toward the majority,0
class. The class :class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.RandomOverSampler`,0
implements such of a strategy.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"By default, random over-sampling generates a bootstrap. The parameter",0
`shrinkage` allows adding a small perturbation to the generated data,0
to generate a smoothed bootstrap instead. The plot below shows the difference,0
between the two data generation strategies.,0
%%,0

It looks like more samples are generated with smoothed bootstrap. This is due,0
to the fact that the samples generated are not superimposing with the,0
original samples.,0

during the resampling. The borderline version,0

select which are in the border between two classes. The SVM version,0
(:class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.SVMSMOTE`) will use the support vectors,0
found using an SVM algorithm to create new sample while the KMeans version,0

Problem definition,0
------------------,0
,0
We are dropping the following features:,0
,0
"- ""fnlwgt"": this feature was created while studying the ""adult"" dataset.",0
"Thus, we will not use this feature which is not acquired during the survey.",0
"- ""education-num"": it is encoding the same information than ""education"".",0
"Thus, we are removing one of these 2 features.",0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"The ""adult"" dataset as a class ratio of about 3:1",0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
This dataset is only slightly imbalanced. To better highlight the effect of,0
"learning from an imbalanced dataset, we will increase its ratio to 30:1",0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
We will perform a cross-validation evaluation to get an estimate of the test,0
score.,0
,0
"As a baseline, we could use a classifier which will always predict the",0
majority class independently of the features provided.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"Instead of using the accuracy, we can use the balanced accuracy which will",0
take into account the balancing issue.,0
%%,0

Strategies to learn from an imbalanced dataset,0
----------------------------------------------,0
We will use a dictionary and a list to continuously store the results of,0
our experiments and show them as a pandas dataframe.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
Dummy baseline,0
..............,0
,0
"Before to train a real machine learning model, we can store the results",0
obtained with our :class:`~sklearn.dummy.DummyClassifier`.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
Linear classifier baseline,0
..........................,0
,0
We will create a machine learning pipeline using a,0
":class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` classifier. In this regard,",0
we will need to one-hot encode the categorical columns and standardized the,0
numerical columns before to inject the data into the,0
:class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` classifier.,0
,0
"First, we define our numerical and categorical pipelines.",0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"Then, we can create a preprocessor which will dispatch the categorical",0
columns to the categorical pipeline and the numerical columns to the,0
numerical pipeline,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"Finally, we connect our preprocessor with our",0
:class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression`. We can then evaluate our,0
model.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
We can see that our linear model is learning slightly better than our dummy,0
"baseline. However, it is impacted by the class imbalance.",0
,0
We can verify that something similar is happening with a tree-based model,0
such as :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`. With this type of,0
"classifier, we will not need to scale the numerical data, and we will only",0
need to ordinal encode the categorical data.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
The :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier` is as well affected by,0
"the class imbalanced, slightly less than the linear model. Now, we will",0
present different approach to improve the performance of these 2 models.,0
,0
Use `class_weight`,0
..................,0
,0
Most of the models in `scikit-learn` have a parameter `class_weight`. This,0
parameter will affect the computation of the loss in linear model or the,0
criterion in the tree-based model to penalize differently a false,0
classification from the minority and majority class. We can set,0
"`class_weight=""balanced""` such that the weight applied is inversely",0
proportional to the class frequency. We test this parametrization in both,0
linear model and tree-based model.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
We can see that using `class_weight` was really effective for the linear,0
"model, alleviating the issue of learning from imbalanced classes. However,",0
the :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier` is still biased toward,0
"the majority class, mainly due to the criterion which is not suited enough to",0
fight the class imbalance.,0
,0
Resample the training set during learning,0
.........................................,0
,0
Another way is to resample the training set by under-sampling or,0
over-sampling some of the samples. `imbalanced-learn` provides some samplers,0
to do such processing.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
Applying a random under-sampler before the training of the linear model or,0
"random forest, allows to not focus on the majority class at the cost of",0
making more mistake for samples in the majority class (i.e. decreased,0
accuracy).,0
,0
We could apply any type of samplers and find which sampler is working best,0
on the current dataset.,0
,0
"Instead, we will present another way by using classifiers which will apply",0
sampling internally.,0
,0
Use of specific balanced algorithms from imbalanced-learn,0
.........................................................,0
,0
We already showed that random under-sampling can be effective on decision,0
"tree. However, instead of under-sampling once the dataset, one could",0
under-sample the original dataset before to take a bootstrap sample. This is,0
the base of the :class:`imblearn.ensemble.BalancedRandomForestClassifier` and,0
:class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedBaggingClassifier`.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
The performance with the,0
:class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedRandomForestClassifier` is better than,0
applying a single random under-sampling. We will use a gradient-boosting,0
classifier within a :class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedBaggingClassifier`.,0
%% [markdown],0
This last approach is the most effective. The different under-sampling allows,0
to bring some diversity for the different GBDT to learn and not focus on a,0
portion of the majority class.,0

Random over-sampling to balance the data set,0
--------------------------------------------,0
,0
Random over-sampling can be used to repeat some samples and balance the,0
number of samples between the dataset. It can be seen that with this trivial,0
approach the boundary decision is already less biased toward the majority,0
class. The class :class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.RandomOverSampler`,0
implements such of a strategy.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"By default, random over-sampling generates a bootstrap. The parameter",0
`shrinkage` allows adding a small perturbation to the generated data,0
to generate a smoothed bootstrap instead. The plot below shows the difference,0
between the two data generation strategies.,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
It looks like more samples are generated with smoothed bootstrap. This is due,0
to the fact that the samples generated are not superimposing with the,0
original samples.,0
,0
More advanced over-sampling using ADASYN and SMOTE,0
--------------------------------------------------,0
,0
Instead of repeating the same samples when over-sampling or perturbating the,0
"generated bootstrap samples, one can use some specific heuristic instead.",0
:class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.ADASYN` and,0
:class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.SMOTE` can be used in this case.,0

The following plot illustrates the difference between,0
:class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.ADASYN` and,0
:class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.SMOTE`.,0
:class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.ADASYN` will focus on the samples which are,0
difficult to classify with a nearest-neighbors rule while regular,0
:class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.SMOTE` will not make any distinction.,0
"Therefore, the decision function depending of the algorithm.",0
%% [markdown],0
"Due to those sampling particularities, it can give rise to some specific",0
issues as illustrated below.,0

SMOTE proposes several variants by identifying specific samples to consider,0
during the resampling. The borderline version,0
(:class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.BorderlineSMOTE`) will detect which point to,0
select which are in the border between two classes. The SVM version,0
(:class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.SVMSMOTE`) will use the support vectors,0
found using an SVM algorithm to create new sample while the KMeans version,0
(:class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.KMeansSMOTE`) will make a clustering before,0

:class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` classifier.,0
,0
"First, we define our numerical and categorical pipelines.",0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"Then, we can create a preprocessor which will dispatch the categorical",0
columns to the categorical pipeline and the numerical columns to the,0
numerical pipeline,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
"Finally, we connect our preprocessor with our",0
:class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression`. We can then evaluate our,0
model.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
We can see that our linear model is learning slightly better than our dummy,0
"baseline. However, it is impacted by the class imbalance.",0
,0
We can verify that something similar is happening with a tree-based model,0
such as :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`. With this type of,0
"classifier, we will not need to scale the numerical data, and we will only",0
need to ordinal encode the categorical data.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
The :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier` is as well affected by,0
"the class imbalanced, slightly less than the linear model. Now, we will",0
present different approach to improve the performance of these 2 models.,0
,0
Use `class_weight`,0
..................,0
,0
Most of the models in `scikit-learn` have a parameter `class_weight`. This,0
parameter will affect the computation of the loss in linear model or the,0
criterion in the tree-based model to penalize differently a false,0
classification from the minority and majority class. We can set,0
"`class_weight=""balanced""` such that the weight applied is inversely",0
proportional to the class frequency. We test this parametrization in both,0
linear model and tree-based model.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
We can see that using `class_weight` was really effective for the linear,0
"model, alleviating the issue of learning from imbalanced classes. However,",0
the :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier` is still biased toward,0
"the majority class, mainly due to the criterion which is not suited enough to",0
fight the class imbalance.,0
,0
Resample the training set during learning,0
.........................................,0
,0
Another way is to resample the training set by under-sampling or,0
over-sampling some of the samples. `imbalanced-learn` provides some samplers,0
to do such processing.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
Applying a random under-sampler before the training of the linear model or,0
"random forest, allows to not focus on the majority class at the cost of",0
making more mistake for samples in the majority class (i.e. decreased,0
accuracy).,0
,0
We could apply any type of samplers and find which sampler is working best,0
on the current dataset.,0
,0
"Instead, we will present another way by using classifiers which will apply",0
sampling internally.,0
,0
Use of specific balanced algorithms from imbalanced-learn,0
.........................................................,0
,0
We already showed that random under-sampling can be effective on decision,0
"tree. However, instead of under-sampling once the dataset, one could",0
under-sample the original dataset before to take a bootstrap sample. This is,0
the base of the :class:`imblearn.ensemble.BalancedRandomForestClassifier` and,0
:class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedBaggingClassifier`.,0
%%,0
%%,0
%% [markdown],0
The performance with the,0
:class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedRandomForestClassifier` is better than,0
applying a single random under-sampling. We will use a gradient-boosting,0
classifier within a :class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedBaggingClassifier`.,0
%% [markdown],0
This last approach is the most effective. The different under-sampling allows,0
to bring some diversity for the different GBDT to learn and not focus on a,0
portion of the majority class.,0

-----------------------------------------,0

"To improve the prediction of the class \#3, it could be interesting to apply",0
"a balancing before to train the naive bayes classifier. Therefore, we will",0
use a :class:`~imblearn.under_sampling.RandomUnderSampler` to equalize the,0
number of samples in all the classes before the training.,0

It is also important to note that we are using the,0
:class:`~imblearn.pipeline.make_pipeline` function implemented in,0
imbalanced-learn to properly handle the samplers.,0

"Although the results are almost identical, it can be seen that the resampling",0

,0
`sampling_strategy` can be given as a string which specify the class,0

samples will be equalized.,0

"When `sampling_strategy` is a `dict`, the keys correspond to the targeted",0
classes. The values correspond to the desired number of samples for each,0
targeted class. This is working for both **under- and over-sampling**,0

Random over-sampling to balance the data set,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
Random over-sampling can be used to repeat some samples and balance the,0
number of samples between the dataset. It can be seen that with this trivial,0
approach the boundary decision is already less biaised toward the majority,0
class.,0
##############################################################################,0

##############################################################################,0

##############################################################################,0
SMOTE proposes several variants by identifying specific samples to consider,0
during the resampling. The borderline version will detect which point to,0
select which are in the border between two classes. The SVM version will use,0
the support vectors found using an SVM algorithm to create new sample while,0
the KMeans version will make a clustering before to generate samples in each,0
cluster independently depending each cluster density.,0

The algorithm performing prototype selection can be subdivided into two,0
groups: (i) the controlled under-sampling methods and (ii) the cleaning,0
under-sampling methods.,0
##############################################################################,0
"With the controlled under-sampling methods, the number of samples to be",0
selected can be specified. ``RandomUnderSampler`` is the most naive way of,0
performing such selection by randomly selecting a given number of samples by,0
the targetted class.,0
##############################################################################,0
``NearMiss`` algorithms implement some heuristic rules in order to select,0
samples. NearMiss-1 selects samples from the majority class for which the,0
average distance of the :math:`k`` nearest samples of the minority class is,0
the smallest. NearMiss-2 selects the samples from the majority class for,0
which the average distance to the farthest samples of the negative class is,0
"the smallest. NearMiss-3 is a 2-step algorithm: first, for each minority",0
"sample, their ::math:`m` nearest-neighbors will be kept; then, the majority",0
samples selected are the on for which the average distance to the :math:`k`,0
nearest neighbors is the largest.,0
##############################################################################,0
``EditedNearestNeighbours`` removes samples of the majority class for which,0
their class differ from the one of their nearest-neighbors. This sieve can be,0
repeated which is the principle of the,0
``RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbours``. ``AllKNN`` is slightly different from,0
the ``RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbours`` by changing the :math:`k` parameter,0
"of the internal nearest neighors algorithm, increasing it at each iteration.",0
##############################################################################,0
``CondensedNearestNeighbour`` makes use of a 1-NN to iteratively decide if a,0
sample should be kept in a dataset or not. The issue is that,0
``CondensedNearestNeighbour`` is sensitive to noise by preserving the noisy,0
samples. ``OneSidedSelection`` also used the 1-NN and use ``TomekLinks`` to,0
remove the samples considered noisy. The ``NeighbourhoodCleaningRule`` use a,0
"``EditedNearestNeighbours`` to remove some sample. Additionally, they use a 3",0
nearest-neighbors to remove samples which do not agree with this rule.,0

samples. All samples which are classified with a low probability will be,0
removed.,0

##############################################################################,0

##############################################################################,0
Strategies to learn from an imbalanced dataset,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
We will first define a helper function which will train a given model,0
and compute both accuracy and balanced accuracy. The results will be stored,0
in a dataframe,0
Let's define an empty dataframe to store the results,0
##############################################################################,0
Dummy baseline,0
..............,0
,0
"Before to train a real machine learning model, we can store the results",0
obtained with our `DummyClassifier`.,0
##############################################################################,0
Linear classifier baseline,0
..........................,0
,0
We will create a machine learning pipeline using a `LogisticRegression`,0
"classifier. In this regard, we will need to one-hot encode the categorical",0
columns and standardized the numerical columns before to inject the data into,0
the `LogisticRegression` classifier.,0
,0
"First, we define our numerical and categorical pipelines.",0
##############################################################################,0
"Then, we can create a preprocessor which will dispatch the categorical",0
columns to the categorical pipeline and the numerical columns to the,0
numerical pipeline,0
##############################################################################,0
"Finally, we connect our preprocessor with our `LogisticRegression`. We can",0
then evaluate our model.,0
##############################################################################,0
We can see that our linear model is learning slightly better than our dummy,0
"baseline. However, it is impacted by the class imbalance.",0
,0
We can verify that something similar is happening with a tree-based model,0
"such as `RandomForestClassifier`. With this type of classifier, we will not",0
"need to scale the numerical data, and we will only need to ordinal encode the",0
categorical data.,0
##############################################################################,0
"The `RandomForestClassifier` is as well affected by the class imbalanced,",0
"slightly less than the linear model. Now, we will present different approach",0
to improve the performance of these 2 models.,0
,0
Use `class_weight`,0
..................,0
,0
Most of the models in `scikit-learn` have a parameter `class_weight`. This,0
parameter will affect the computation of the loss in linear model or the,0
criterion in the tree-based model to penalize differently a false,0
classification from the minority and majority class. We can set,0
"`class_weight=""balanced""` such that the weight applied is inversely",0
proportional to the class frequency. We test this parametrization in both,0
linear model and tree-based model.,0
##############################################################################,0
,0
##############################################################################,0
We can see that using `class_weight` was really effective for the linear,0
"model, alleviating the issue of learning from imbalanced classes. However,",0
"the `RandomForestClassifier` is still biased toward the majority class,",0
mainly due to the criterion which is not suited enough to fight the class,0
imbalance.,0
,0
Resample the training set during learning,0
.........................................,0
,0
Another way is to resample the training set by under-sampling or,0
over-sampling some of the samples. `imbalanced-learn` provides some samplers,0
to do such processing.,0
##############################################################################,0
,0
##############################################################################,0
Applying a random under-sampler before the training of the linear model or,0
"random forest, allows to not focus on the majority class at the cost of",0
making more mistake for samples in the majority class (i.e. decreased,0
accuracy).,0
,0
We could apply any type of samplers and find which sampler is working best,0
on the current dataset.,0
,0
"Instead, we will present another way by using classifiers which will apply",0
sampling internally.,0
,0
Use of `BalancedRandomForestClassifier` and `BalancedBaggingClassifier`,0
.......................................................................,0
,0
We already showed that random under-sampling can be effective on decision,0
"tree. However, instead of under-sampling once the dataset, one could",0
under-sample the original dataset before to take a bootstrap sample. This is,0
the base of the `BalancedRandomForestClassifier` and,0
`BalancedBaggingClassifier`.,0
##############################################################################,0
The performance with the `BalancedRandomForestClassifier` is better than,0
applying a single random under-sampling. We will use a gradient-boosting,0
classifier within a `BalancedBaggingClassifier`.,0
##############################################################################,0
This last approach is the most effective. The different under-sampling allows,0
to bring some diversity for the different GBDT to learn and not focus on a,0
portion of the majority class.,0
,0
We will repeat the same experiment but with a ratio of 100:1 and make a,0
similar analysis.,0
##############################################################################,0
Increase imbalanced ratio,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
"When we analyse the results, we can draw similar conclusions than in the",0
"previous discussion. However, we can observe that the strategy",0
"`class_weight=""balanced""` does not improve the performance when using a",0
`RandomForestClassifier`. A resampling is indeed required. The most effective,0
method remains the `BalancedBaggingClassifier` using a GBDT as a base,0
learner.,0

##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0

##############################################################################,0
Random over-sampling to balance the data set,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
Random over-sampling can be used to repeat some samples and balance the,0
number of samples between the dataset. It can be seen that with this trivial,0
approach the boundary decision is already less biaised toward the majority,0
class.,0
##############################################################################,0
More advanced over-sampling using ADASYN and SMOTE,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
"Instead of repeating the same samples when over-sampling, we can use some",0
specific heuristic instead. ADASYN and SMOTE can be used in this case.,0
Make an identity sampler,0
##############################################################################,0
The following plot illustrate the difference between ADASYN and SMOTE. ADASYN,0
will focus on the samples which are difficult to classify with a,0
nearest-neighbors rule while regular SMOTE will not make any distinction.,0
"Therefore, the decision function depending of the algorithm.",0
##############################################################################,0
"Due to those sampling particularities, it can give rise to some specific",0
issues as illustrated below.,0
##############################################################################,0
SMOTE proposes several variants by identifying specific samples to consider,0
during the resampling. The borderline version will detect which point to,0
select which are in the border between two classes. The SVM version will use,0
the support vectors found using an SVM algorithm to create new sample while,0
the KMeans version will make a clustering before to generate samples in each,0
cluster independently depending each cluster density.,0

"``SMOTE`` allows to generate samples. However, this method of over-sampling",0

"some noisy samples can be generated, e.g. when the different classes cannot",0

algorithm to clean the noisy samples. Two methods are usually used in the,0
literature: (i) Tomek's link and (ii) edited nearest neighbours cleaning,0
methods. Imbalanced-learn provides two ready-to-use samplers ``SMOTETomek``,0
"and ``SMOTEENN``. In general, ``SMOTEENN`` cleans more noisy data than",0

##############################################################################,0
"Instead of using a single tree, we will check if an ensemble of decsion tree",0
"can actually alleviate the issue induced by the class imbalancing. First, we",0
will use a bagging classifier and its counter part which internally uses a,0
random under-sampling to balanced each boostrap sample.,0
##############################################################################,0

accuracy and the geometric mean.,0
##############################################################################,0

##############################################################################,0
Random forest is another popular ensemble method and it is usually,0
"outperforming bagging. Here, we used a vanilla random forest and its balanced",0

##############################################################################,0
Prototype selection: under-sampling by selecting existing samples,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
The algorithm performing prototype selection can be subdivided into two,0
groups: (i) the controlled under-sampling methods and (ii) the cleaning,0
under-sampling methods.,0
##############################################################################,0
"With the controlled under-sampling methods, the number of samples to be",0
selected can be specified. ``RandomUnderSampler`` is the most naive way of,0
performing such selection by randomly selecting a given number of samples by,0
the targetted class.,0
##############################################################################,0
``NearMiss`` algorithms implement some heuristic rules in order to select,0
samples. NearMiss-1 selects samples from the majority class for which the,0
average distance of the :math:`k`` nearest samples of the minority class is,0
the smallest. NearMiss-2 selects the samples from the majority class for,0
which the average distance to the farthest samples of the negative class is,0
"the smallest. NearMiss-3 is a 2-step algorithm: first, for each minority",0
"sample, their ::math:`m` nearest-neighbors will be kept; then, the majority",0
samples selected are the on for which the average distance to the :math:`k`,0
nearest neighbors is the largest.,0
##############################################################################,0
``EditedNearestNeighbours`` removes samples of the majority class for which,0
their class differ from the one of their nearest-neighbors. This sieve can be,0
repeated which is the principle of the,0
``RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbours``. ``AllKNN`` is slightly different from,0
the ``RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbours`` by changing the :math:`k` parameter,0
"of the internal nearest neighors algorithm, increasing it at each iteration.",0
##############################################################################,0
``CondensedNearestNeighbour`` makes use of a 1-NN to iteratively decide if a,0
sample should be kept in a dataset or not. The issue is that,0
``CondensedNearestNeighbour`` is sensitive to noise by preserving the noisy,0
samples. ``OneSidedSelection`` also used the 1-NN and use ``TomekLinks`` to,0
remove the samples considered noisy. The ``NeighbourhoodCleaningRule`` use a,0
"``EditedNearestNeighbours`` to remove some sample. Additionally, they use a 3",0
nearest-neighbors to remove samples which do not agree with this rule.,0
##############################################################################,0
``InstanceHardnessThreshold`` uses the prediction of classifier to exclude,0
samples. All samples which are classified with a low probability will be,0
removed.,0

##############################################################################,0
we are dropping the following features:,0
"- ""fnlwgt"": this feature was created while studying the ""adult"" dataset.",0
"Thus, we will not use this feature which is not acquired during the survey.",0
"- ""education-num"": it is encoding the same information than ""education"".",0
"Thus, we are removing one of these 2 features.",0
##############################################################################,0
"The ""adult"" dataset as a class ratio of about 3:1",0
##############################################################################,0
This dataset is only slightly imbalanced. To better highlight the effect of,0
"learning from an imbalanced dataset, we will increase its ratio to 30:1",0
##############################################################################,0
"For the rest of the notebook, we will make a single split to get training",0
and testing data. Note that you should use cross-validation to have an,0
estimate of the performance variation in practice.,0
##############################################################################,0
"As a baseline, we could use a classifier which will always predict the",0
majority class independently of the features provided.,0
#############################################################################,0
"Instead of using the accuracy, we can use the balanced accuracy which will",0
take into account the balancing issue.,0
##############################################################################,0
Strategies to learn from an imbalanced dataset,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
We will first define a helper function which will train a given model,0
and compute both accuracy and balanced accuracy. The results will be stored,0
in a dataframe,0
Let's define an empty dataframe to store the results,0
##############################################################################,0
Dummy baseline,0
..............,0
,0
"Before to train a real machine learning model, we can store the results",0
obtained with our `DummyClassifier`.,0
##############################################################################,0
Linear classifier baseline,0
..........................,0
,0
We will create a machine learning pipeline using a `LogisticRegression`,0
"classifier. In this regard, we will need to one-hot encode the categorical",0
columns and standardized the numerical columns before to inject the data into,0
the `LogisticRegression` classifier.,0
,0
"First, we define our numerical and categorical pipelines.",0
##############################################################################,0
"Then, we can create a preprocessor which will dispatch the categorical",0
columns to the categorical pipeline and the numerical columns to the,0
numerical pipeline,0
##############################################################################,0
"Finally, we connect our preprocessor with our `LogisticRegression`. We can",0
then evaluate our model.,0
##############################################################################,0
We can see that our linear model is learning slightly better than our dummy,0
"baseline. However, it is impacted by the class imbalance.",0
,0
We can verify that something similar is happening with a tree-based model,0
"such as `RandomForestClassifier`. With this type of classifier, we will not",0
"need to scale the numerical data, and we will only need to ordinal encode the",0
categorical data.,0
##############################################################################,0
"The `RandomForestClassifier` is as well affected by the class imbalanced,",0
"slightly less than the linear model. Now, we will present different approach",0
to improve the performance of these 2 models.,0
,0
Use `class_weight`,0
..................,0
,0
Most of the models in `scikit-learn` have a parameter `class_weight`. This,0
parameter will affect the computation of the loss in linear model or the,0
criterion in the tree-based model to penalize differently a false,0
classification from the minority and majority class. We can set,0
"`class_weight=""balanced""` such that the weight applied is inversely",0
proportional to the class frequency. We test this parametrization in both,0
linear model and tree-based model.,0
##############################################################################,0
,0
##############################################################################,0
We can see that using `class_weight` was really effective for the linear,0
"model, alleviating the issue of learning from imbalanced classes. However,",0
"the `RandomForestClassifier` is still biased toward the majority class,",0
mainly due to the criterion which is not suited enough to fight the class,0
imbalance.,0
,0
Resample the training set during learning,0
.........................................,0
,0
Another way is to resample the training set by under-sampling or,0
over-sampling some of the samples. `imbalanced-learn` provides some samplers,0
to do such processing.,0
##############################################################################,0
,0
##############################################################################,0
Applying a random under-sampler before the training of the linear model or,0
"random forest, allows to not focus on the majority class at the cost of",0
making more mistake for samples in the majority class (i.e. decreased,0
accuracy).,0
,0
We could apply any type of samplers and find which sampler is working best,0
on the current dataset.,0
,0
"Instead, we will present another way by using classifiers which will apply",0
sampling internally.,0
,0
Use of `BalancedRandomForestClassifier` and `BalancedBaggingClassifier`,0
.......................................................................,0
,0
We already showed that random under-sampling can be effective on decision,0
"tree. However, instead of under-sampling once the dataset, one could",0
under-sample the original dataset before to take a bootstrap sample. This is,0
the base of the `BalancedRandomForestClassifier` and,0
`BalancedBaggingClassifier`.,0
##############################################################################,0
The performance with the `BalancedRandomForestClassifier` is better than,0
applying a single random under-sampling. We will use a gradient-boosting,0
classifier within a `BalancedBaggingClassifier`.,0
##############################################################################,0
This last approach is the most effective. The different under-sampling allows,0
to bring some diversity for the different GBDT to learn and not focus on a,0
portion of the majority class.,0
,0
We will repeat the same experiment but with a ratio of 100:1 and make a,0
similar analysis.,0
##############################################################################,0
Increase imbalanced ratio,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
"When we analyse the results, we can draw similar conclusions than in the",0
"previous discussion. However, we can observe that the strategy",0
"`class_weight=""balanced""` does not improve the performance when using a",0
`RandomForestClassifier`. A resampling is indeed required. The most effective,0
method remains the `BalancedBaggingClassifier` using a GBDT as a base,0
learner.,0

Setting the data set,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
We use a part of the 20 newsgroups data set by loading 4 topics. Using the,0
"scikit-learn loader, the data are split into a training and a testing set.",0
,0
Note the class \#3 is the minority class and has almost twice less samples,0
than the majority class.,0
##############################################################################,0
The usual scikit-learn pipeline,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
You might usually use scikit-learn pipeline by combining the TF-IDF,0
vectorizer to feed a multinomial naive bayes classifier. A classification,0
report summarized the results on the testing set.,0
,0
"As expected, the recall of the class \#3 is low mainly due to the class",0
imbalanced.,0
##############################################################################,0
Balancing the class before classification,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
"To improve the prediction of the class \#3, it could be interesting to apply",0
"a balancing before to train the naive bayes classifier. Therefore, we will",0
use a ``RandomUnderSampler`` to equalize the number of samples in all the,0
classes before the training.,0
,0
It is also important to note that we are using the ``make_pipeline`` function,0
implemented in imbalanced-learn to properly handle the samplers.,0
##############################################################################,0
"Although the results are almost identical, it can be seen that the resampling",0
allowed to correct the poor recall of the class \#3 at the cost of reducing,0
"the other metrics for the other classes. However, the overall results are",0
slightly better.,0

##############################################################################,0
We will first illustrate the influence of the balancing ratio on some toy,0

Random over-sampling to balance the data set,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
Random over-sampling can be used to repeat some samples and balance the,0
number of samples between the dataset. It can be seen that with this trivial,0
approach the boundary decision is already less biaised toward the majority,0
class.,0
##############################################################################,0
More advanced over-sampling using ADASYN and SMOTE,0

##############################################################################,0
The following plot illustrate the difference between ADASYN and SMOTE. ADASYN,0
will focus on the samples which are difficult to classify with a,0
nearest-neighbors rule while regular SMOTE will not make any distinction.,0
"Therefore, the decision function depending of the algorithm.",0
##############################################################################,0
"Due to those sampling particularities, it can give rise to some specific",0
issues as illustrated below.,0
##############################################################################,0
SMOTE proposes several variants by identifying specific samples to consider,0
during the resampling. The borderline version will detect which point to,0
select which are in the border between two classes. The SVM version will use,0
the support vectors found using an SVM algorithm to create new sample while,0
the KMeans version will make a clustering before to generate samples in each,0
cluster independently depending each cluster density.,0

"``SMOTE`` allows to generate samples. However, this method of over-sampling",0
"does not have any knowledge regarding the underlying distribution. Therefore,",0
"some noisy samples can be generated, e.g. when the different classes cannot",0
"be well separated. Hence, it can be beneficial to apply an under-sampling",0
algorithm to clean the noisy samples. Two methods are usually used in the,0
literature: (i) Tomek's link and (ii) edited nearest neighbours cleaning,0
methods. Imbalanced-learn provides two ready-to-use samplers ``SMOTETomek``,0
"and ``SMOTEENN``. In general, ``SMOTEENN`` cleans more noisy data than",0
``SMOTETomek``.,0

Classification using bagging classifier with and without sampling,0
##############################################################################,0
"Instead of using a single tree, we will check if an ensemble of decsion tree",0
"can actually alleviate the issue induced by the class imbalancing. First, we",0
will use a bagging classifier and its counter part which internally uses a,0
random under-sampling to balanced each boostrap sample.,0
##############################################################################,0
Balancing each bootstrap sample allows to increase significantly the balanced,0
accuracy and the geometric mean.,0
##############################################################################,0
Classification using random forest classifier with and without sampling,0
##############################################################################,0
Random forest is another popular ensemble method and it is usually,0
"outperforming bagging. Here, we used a vanilla random forest and its balanced",0

Prototype selection: under-sampling by selecting existing samples,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
The algorithm performing prototype selection can be subdivided into two,0
groups: (i) the controlled under-sampling methods and (ii) the cleaning,0
under-sampling methods.,0
##############################################################################,0
"With the controlled under-sampling methods, the number of samples to be",0
selected can be specified. ``RandomUnderSampler`` is the most naive way of,0
performing such selection by randomly selecting a given number of samples by,0
the targetted class.,0
##############################################################################,0
``NearMiss`` algorithms implement some heuristic rules in order to select,0
samples. NearMiss-1 selects samples from the majority class for which the,0
average distance of the :math:`k`` nearest samples of the minority class is,0
the smallest. NearMiss-2 selects the samples from the majority class for,0
which the average distance to the farthest samples of the negative class is,0
"the smallest. NearMiss-3 is a 2-step algorithm: first, for each minority",0
"sample, their ::math:`m` nearest-neighbors will be kept; then, the majority",0
samples selected are the on for which the average distance to the :math:`k`,0
nearest neighbors is the largest.,0
##############################################################################,0
``EditedNearestNeighbours`` removes samples of the majority class for which,0
their class differ from the one of their nearest-neighbors. This sieve can be,0
repeated which is the principle of the,0
``RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbours``. ``AllKNN`` is slightly different from,0
the ``RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbours`` by changing the :math:`k` parameter,0
"of the internal nearest neighors algorithm, increasing it at each iteration.",0
##############################################################################,0
``CondensedNearestNeighbour`` makes use of a 1-NN to iteratively decide if a,0
sample should be kept in a dataset or not. The issue is that,0
``CondensedNearestNeighbour`` is sensitive to noise by preserving the noisy,0
samples. ``OneSidedSelection`` also used the 1-NN and use ``TomekLinks`` to,0
remove the samples considered noisy. The ``NeighbourhoodCleaningRule`` use a,0
"``EditedNearestNeighbours`` to remove some sample. Additionally, they use a 3",0
nearest-neighbors to remove samples which do not agree with this rule.,0
##############################################################################,0
``InstanceHardnessThreshold`` uses the prediction of classifier to exclude,0
samples. All samples which are classified with a low probability will be,0
removed.,0

"example, we use a 3-NN to compute the average distance on 2 specific samples",0
"of the majority class. Therefore, in this case the point linked by the",0
green-dashed line will be selected since the average distance is smaller.,0
##############################################################################,0

NearMiss-2 selects samples from the majority class for which the average,0

"Thus, we will not use this feature which is not acquired during the survey.",0

"Thus, we are removing one of these 2 features.",0
##############################################################################,0
"The ""adult"" dataset as a class ratio of about 3:1",0
##############################################################################,0
This dataset is only slightly imbalanced. To better highlight the effect of,0
"learning from an imbalanced dataset, we will increase its ratio to 30:1",0
##############################################################################,0
"For the rest of the notebook, we will make a single split to get training",0
and testing data. Note that you should use cross-validation to have an,0
estimate of the performance variation in practice.,0
##############################################################################,0
"As a baseline, we could use a classifier which will always predict the",0
majority class independently of the features provided.,0
#############################################################################,0

take into account the balancing issue.,0
##############################################################################,0
Strategies to learn from an imbalanced dataset,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
We will first define a helper function which will train a given model,0
and compute both accuracy and balanced accuracy. The results will be stored,0
in a dataframe,0
Let's define an empty dataframe to store the results,0
##############################################################################,0
Dummy baseline,0
..............,0
,0
"Before to train a real machine learning model, we can store the results",0
obtained with our `DummyClassifier`.,0
##############################################################################,0
Linear classifier baseline,0
..........................,0
,0
We will create a machine learning pipeline using a `LogisticRegression`,0
"classifier. In this regard, we will need to one-hot encode the categorical",0
columns and standardized the numerical columns before to inject the data into,0
the `LogisticRegression` classifier.,0
,0
"First, we define our numerical and categorical pipelines.",0
##############################################################################,0
"Then, we can create a preprocessor which will dispatch the categorical",0
columns to the categorical pipeline and the numerical columns to the,0
numerical pipeline,0
##############################################################################,0
"Finally, we connect our preprocessor with our `LogisticRegression`. We can",0
then evaluate our model.,0
##############################################################################,0
We can see that our linear model is learning slightly better than our dummy,0
"baseline. However, it is impacted by the class imbalance.",0
,0
We can verify that something similar is happening with a tree-based model,0
"such as `RandomForestClassifier`. With this type of classifier, we will not",0
"need to scale the numerical data, and we will only need to ordinal encode the",0
categorical data.,0
##############################################################################,0
"The `RandomForestClassifier` is as well affected by the class imbalanced,",0
"slightly less than the linear model. Now, we will present different approach",0
to improve the performance of these 2 models.,0
,0
Use `class_weight`,0
..................,0
,0
Most of the models in `scikit-learn` have a parameter `class_weight`. This,0
parameter will affect the computation of the loss in linear model or the,0
criterion in the tree-based model to penalize differently a false,0
classification from the minority and majority class. We can set,0
"`class_weight=""balanced""` such that the weight applied is inversely",0
proportional to the class frequency. We test this parametrization in both,0
linear model and tree-based model.,0
##############################################################################,0
,0
##############################################################################,0
We can see that using `class_weight` was really effective for the linear,0
"model, alleviating the issue of learning from imbalanced classes. However,",0
"the `RandomForestClassifier` is still biased toward the majority class,",0
mainly due to the criterion which is not suited enough to fight the class,0
imbalance.,0
,0
Resample the training set during learning,0
.........................................,0
,0
Another way is to resample the training set by under-sampling or,0
over-sampling some of the samples. `imbalanced-learn` provides some samplers,0
to do such processing.,0
##############################################################################,0
,0
##############################################################################,0
Applying a random under-sampler before the training of the linear model or,0
"random forest, allows to not focus on the majority class at the cost of",0
making more mistake for samples in the majority class (i.e. decreased,0
accuracy).,0
,0
We could apply any type of samplers and find which sampler is working best,0
on the current dataset.,0
,0
"Instead, we will present another way by using classifiers which will apply",0
sampling internally.,0
,0
Use of `BalancedRandomForestClassifier` and `BalancedBaggingClassifier`,0
.......................................................................,0
,0
We already showed that random under-sampling can be effective on decision,0
"tree. However, instead of under-sampling once the dataset, one could",0
under-sample the original dataset before to take a bootstrap sample. This is,0
the base of the `BalancedRandomForestClassifier` and,0
`BalancedBaggingClassifier`.,0
##############################################################################,0
The performance with the `BalancedRandomForestClassifier` is better than,0
applying a single random under-sampling. We will use a gradient-boosting,0
classifier within a `BalancedBaggingClassifier`.,0
##############################################################################,0
This last approach is the most effective. The different under-sampling allows,0
to bring some diversity for the different GBDT to learn and not focus on a,0
portion of the majority class.,0
,0
We will repeat the same experiment but with a ratio of 100:1 and make a,0
similar analysis.,0
##############################################################################,0
Increase imbalanced ratio,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
"When we analyse the results, we can draw similar conclusions than in the",0
"previous discussion. However, we can observe that the strategy",0
"`class_weight=""balanced""` does not improve the performance when using a",0
`RandomForestClassifier`. A resampling is indeed required. The most effective,0
method remains the `BalancedBaggingClassifier` using a GBDT as a base,0
learner.,0

You might usually use scikit-learn pipeline by combining the TF-IDF,0
vectorizer to feed a multinomial naive bayes classifier. A classification,0

imbalanced.,0
##############################################################################,0
Balancing the class before classification,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
"To improve the prediction of the class \#3, it could be interesting to apply",0
"a balancing before to train the naive bayes classifier. Therefore, we will",0
use a ``RandomUnderSampler`` to equalize the number of samples in all the,0
classes before the training.,0
,0
It is also important to note that we are using the ``make_pipeline`` function,0
implemented in imbalanced-learn to properly handle the samplers.,0
##############################################################################,0
"Although the results are almost identical, it can be seen that the resampling",0
allowed to correct the poor recall of the class \#3 at the cost of reducing,0
"the other metrics for the other classes. However, the overall results are",0
slightly better.,0

##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
We will first illustrate the influence of the balancing ratio on some toy,0

"number of samples in each class, poorer are the classfication results.",0
##############################################################################,0
Random over-sampling to balance the data set,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
Random over-sampling can be used to repeat some samples and balance the,0
number of samples between the dataset. It can be seen that with this trivial,0
approach the boundary decision is already less biaised toward the majority,0
class.,0
##############################################################################,0
More advanced over-sampling using ADASYN and SMOTE,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
"Instead of repeating the same samples when over-sampling, we can use some",0
specific heuristic instead. ADASYN and SMOTE can be used in this case.,0
Make an identity sampler,0
##############################################################################,0
The following plot illustrate the difference between ADASYN and SMOTE. ADASYN,0
will focus on the samples which are difficult to classify with a,0
nearest-neighbors rule while regular SMOTE will not make any distinction.,0
"Therefore, the decision function depending of the algorithm.",0

"Due to those sampling particularities, it can give rise to some specific",0

##############################################################################,0
SMOTE proposes several variants by identifying specific samples to consider,0
during the resampling. The borderline version will detect which point to,0
select which are in the border between two classes. The SVM version will use,0
the support vectors found using an SVM algorithm to create new sample while,0
the KMeans version will make a clustering before to generate samples in each,0
cluster independently depending each cluster density.,0

"``SMOTE`` allows to generate samples. However, this method of over-sampling",0

"some noisy samples can be generated, e.g. when the different classes cannot",0

algorithm to clean the noisy samples. Two methods are usually used in the,0
literature: (i) Tomek's link and (ii) edited nearest neighbours cleaning,0
methods. Imbalanced-learn provides two ready-to-use samplers ``SMOTETomek``,0
"and ``SMOTEENN``. In general, ``SMOTEENN`` cleans more noisy data than",0

"Instead of using a single tree, we will check if an ensemble of decsion tree",0

will use a bagging classifier and its counter part which internally uses a,0
random under-sampling to balanced each boostrap sample.,0
##############################################################################,0

accuracy and the geometric mean.,0

Prototype selection: under-sampling by selecting existing samples,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
The algorithm performing prototype selection can be subdivided into two,0
groups: (i) the controlled under-sampling methods and (ii) the cleaning,0
under-sampling methods.,0
##############################################################################,0
"With the controlled under-sampling methods, the number of samples to be",0
selected can be specified. ``RandomUnderSampler`` is the most naive way of,0
performing such selection by randomly selecting a given number of samples by,0
the targetted class.,0
##############################################################################,0
``NearMiss`` algorithms implement some heuristic rules in order to select,0
samples. NearMiss-1 selects samples from the majority class for which the,0
average distance of the :math:`k`` nearest samples of the minority class is,0
the smallest. NearMiss-2 selects the samples from the majority class for,0
which the average distance to the farthest samples of the negative class is,0
"the smallest. NearMiss-3 is a 2-step algorithm: first, for each minority",0
"sample, their ::math:`m` nearest-neighbors will be kept; then, the majority",0
samples selected are the on for which the average distance to the :math:`k`,0
nearest neighbors is the largest.,0
##############################################################################,0
``EditedNearestNeighbours`` removes samples of the majority class for which,0
their class differ from the one of their nearest-neighbors. This sieve can be,0
repeated which is the principle of the,0
``RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbours``. ``AllKNN`` is slightly different from,0
the ``RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbours`` by changing the :math:`k` parameter,0
"of the internal nearest neighors algorithm, increasing it at each iteration.",0
##############################################################################,0
``CondensedNearestNeighbour`` makes use of a 1-NN to iteratively decide if a,0
sample should be kept in a dataset or not. The issue is that,0
``CondensedNearestNeighbour`` is sensitive to noise by preserving the noisy,0
samples. ``OneSidedSelection`` also used the 1-NN and use ``TomekLinks`` to,0
remove the samples considered noisy. The ``NeighbourhoodCleaningRule`` use a,0
"``EditedNearestNeighbours`` to remove some sample. Additionally, they use a 3",0
nearest-neighbors to remove samples which do not agree with this rule.,0
##############################################################################,0
``InstanceHardnessThreshold`` uses the prediction of classifier to exclude,0
samples. All samples which are classified with a low probability will be,0
removed.,0

"example, we use a 3-NN to compute the average distance on 2 specific samples",0
"of the majority class. Therefore, in this case the point linked by the",0
green-dashed line will be selected since the average distance is smaller.,0

..........................,0

We will create a machine learning pipeline using a `LogisticRegression`,0
"classifier. In this regard, we will need to one-hot encode the categorical",0
columns and standardized the numerical columns before to inject the data into,0
the `LogisticRegression` classifier.,0
,0
"First, we define our numerical and categorical pipelines.",0
##############################################################################,0
"Then, we can create a preprocessor which will dispatch the categorical",0
columns to the categorical pipeline and the numerical columns to the,0
numerical pipeline,0
##############################################################################,0
"Finally, we connect our preprocessor with our `LogisticRegression`. We can",0
then evaluate our model.,0
##############################################################################,0
We can see that our linear model is learning slightly better than our dummy,0
"baseline. However, it is impacted by the class imbalance.",0
,0
We can verify that something similar is happening with a tree-based model,0
"such as `RandomForestClassifier`. With this type of classifier, we will not",0
"need to scale the numerical data, and we will only need to ordinal encode the",0
categorical data.,0
##############################################################################,0

parameter will affect the computation of the loss in linear model or the,0
criterion in the tree-based model to penalize differently a false,0
classification from the minority and majority class. We can set,0
"`class_weight=""balanced""` such that the weight applied is inversely",0
proportional to the class frequency. We test this parametrization in both,0
linear model and tree-based model.,0
##############################################################################,0
,0
##############################################################################,0
We can see that using `class_weight` was really effective for the linear,0
"model, alleviating the issue of learning from imbalanced classes. However,",0
"the `RandomForestClassifier` is still biased toward the majority class,",0
mainly due to the criterion which is not suited enough to fight the class,0
imbalance.,0
,0
Resample the training set during learning,0
.........................................,0
,0
Another way is to resample the training set by under-sampling or,0
over-sampling some of the samples. `imbalanced-learn` provides some samplers,0
to do such processing.,0
##############################################################################,0
,0
##############################################################################,0
Applying a random under-sampler before the training of the linear model or,0
"random forest, allows to not focus on the majority class at the cost of",0
making more mistake for samples in the majority class (i.e. decreased,0
accuracy).,0
,0
We could apply any type of samplers and find which sampler is working best,0
on the current dataset.,0
,0
"Instead, we will present another way by using classifiers which will apply",0
sampling internally.,0
,0
Use of `BalancedRandomForestClassifier` and `BalancedBaggingClassifier`,0
.......................................................................,0
,0
We already showed that random under-sampling can be effective on decision,0
"tree. However, instead of under-sampling once the dataset, one could",0
under-sample the original dataset before to take a bootstrap sample. This is,0
the base of the `BalancedRandomForestClassifier` and,0
`BalancedBaggingClassifier`.,0
##############################################################################,0
The performance with the `BalancedRandomForestClassifier` is better than,0
applying a single random under-sampling. We will use a gradient-boosting,0
classifier within a `BalancedBaggingClassifier`.,0
##############################################################################,0
This last approach is the most effective. The different under-sampling allows,0
to bring some diversity for the different GBDT to learn and not focus on a,0
portion of the majority class.,0
,0
We will repeat the same experiment but with a ratio of 100:1 and make a,0
similar analysis.,0
##############################################################################,0
Increase imbalanced ratio,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
"When we analyse the results, we can draw similar conclusions than in the",0
"previous discussion. However, we can observe that the strategy",0
"`class_weight=""balanced""` does not improve the performance when using a",0
`RandomForestClassifier`. A resampling is indeed required. The most effective,0
method remains the `BalancedBaggingClassifier` using a GBDT as a base,0
learner.,0

Setting the data set,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
We use a part of the 20 newsgroups data set by loading 4 topics. Using the,0
"scikit-learn loader, the data are split into a training and a testing set.",0
,0
Note the class \#3 is the minority class and has almost twice less samples,0
than the majority class.,0
##############################################################################,0
The usual scikit-learn pipeline,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
You might usually use scikit-learn pipeline by combining the TF-IDF,0
vectorizer to feed a multinomial naive bayes classifier. A classification,0
report summarized the results on the testing set.,0
,0
"As expected, the recall of the class \#3 is low mainly due to the class",0
imbalanced.,0
##############################################################################,0
Balancing the class before classification,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
"To improve the prediction of the class \#3, it could be interesting to apply",0
"a balancing before to train the naive bayes classifier. Therefore, we will",0
use a ``RandomUnderSampler`` to equalize the number of samples in all the,0
classes before the training.,0
,0
It is also important to note that we are using the ``make_pipeline`` function,0
implemented in imbalanced-learn to properly handle the samplers.,0
##############################################################################,0
"Although the results are almost identical, it can be seen that the resampling",0
allowed to correct the poor recall of the class \#3 at the cost of reducing,0
"the other metrics for the other classes. However, the overall results are",0
slightly better.,0

##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
We will first illustrate the influence of the balancing ratio on some toy,0

"number of samples in each class, poorer are the classfication results.",0
##############################################################################,0
Random over-sampling to balance the data set,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
Random over-sampling can be used to repeat some samples and balance the,0
number of samples between the dataset. It can be seen that with this trivial,0
approach the boundary decision is already less biaised toward the majority,0
class.,0
##############################################################################,0
More advanced over-sampling using ADASYN and SMOTE,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
"Instead of repeating the same samples when over-sampling, we can use some",0
specific heuristic instead. ADASYN and SMOTE can be used in this case.,0
Make an identity sampler,0
##############################################################################,0
The following plot illustrate the difference between ADASYN and SMOTE. ADASYN,0
will focus on the samples which are difficult to classify with a,0
nearest-neighbors rule while regular SMOTE will not make any distinction.,0
"Therefore, the decision function depending of the algorithm.",0
##############################################################################,0
"Due to those sampling particularities, it can give rise to some specific",0
issues as illustrated below.,0
##############################################################################,0
SMOTE proposes several variants by identifying specific samples to consider,0
during the resampling. The borderline version will detect which point to,0
select which are in the border between two classes. The SVM version will use,0
the support vectors found using an SVM algorithm to create new sample while,0
the KMeans version will make a clustering before to generate samples in each,0
cluster independently depending each cluster density.,0

"``SMOTE`` allows to generate samples. However, this method of over-sampling",0

"some noisy samples can be generated, e.g. when the different classes cannot",0
"be well separated. Hence, it can be beneficial to apply an under-sampling",0
algorithm to clean the noisy samples. Two methods are usually used in the,0
literature: (i) Tomek's link and (ii) edited nearest neighbours cleaning,0
methods. Imbalanced-learn provides two ready-to-use samplers ``SMOTETomek``,0
"and ``SMOTEENN``. In general, ``SMOTEENN`` cleans more noisy data than",0

"Instead of using a single tree, we will check if an ensemble of decsion tree",0

accuracy and the geometric mean.,0
##############################################################################,0

##############################################################################,0
Random forest is another popular ensemble method and it is usually,0
"outperforming bagging. Here, we used a vanilla random forest and its balanced",0

Prototype generation: under-sampling by generating new samples,0

``ClusterCentroids`` under-samples by replacing the original samples by the,0
centroids of the cluster found.,0
##############################################################################,0
Prototype selection: under-sampling by selecting existing samples,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
The algorithm performing prototype selection can be subdivided into two,0
groups: (i) the controlled under-sampling methods and (ii) the cleaning,0
under-sampling methods.,0
##############################################################################,0
"With the controlled under-sampling methods, the number of samples to be",0
selected can be specified. ``RandomUnderSampler`` is the most naive way of,0
performing such selection by randomly selecting a given number of samples by,0
the targetted class.,0
##############################################################################,0
``NearMiss`` algorithms implement some heuristic rules in order to select,0
samples. NearMiss-1 selects samples from the majority class for which the,0
average distance of the :math:`k`` nearest samples of the minority class is,0
the smallest. NearMiss-2 selects the samples from the majority class for,0
which the average distance to the farthest samples of the negative class is,0
"the smallest. NearMiss-3 is a 2-step algorithm: first, for each minority",0
"sample, their ::math:`m` nearest-neighbors will be kept; then, the majority",0
samples selected are the on for which the average distance to the :math:`k`,0
nearest neighbors is the largest.,0
##############################################################################,0
``EditedNearestNeighbours`` removes samples of the majority class for which,0
their class differ from the one of their nearest-neighbors. This sieve can be,0
repeated which is the principle of the,0
``RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbours``. ``AllKNN`` is slightly different from,0
the ``RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbours`` by changing the :math:`k` parameter,0
"of the internal nearest neighors algorithm, increasing it at each iteration.",0
##############################################################################,0
``CondensedNearestNeighbour`` makes use of a 1-NN to iteratively decide if a,0
sample should be kept in a dataset or not. The issue is that,0
``CondensedNearestNeighbour`` is sensitive to noise by preserving the noisy,0
samples. ``OneSidedSelection`` also used the 1-NN and use ``TomekLinks`` to,0
remove the samples considered noisy. The ``NeighbourhoodCleaningRule`` use a,0
"``EditedNearestNeighbours`` to remove some sample. Additionally, they use a 3",0
nearest-neighbors to remove samples which do not agree with this rule.,0
##############################################################################,0
``InstanceHardnessThreshold`` uses the prediction of classifier to exclude,0
samples. All samples which are classified with a low probability will be,0
removed.,0

We can run the ``TomekLinks`` sampling to remove the corresponding,0
samples. If ``sampling_strategy='auto'`` only the sample from the majority,0

removed.,0

##############################################################################,0
NearMiss-1 selects samples from the majority class for which the average,0
distance to some nearest neighbours is the smallest. In the following,0
"example, we use a 3-NN to compute the average distance on 2 specific samples",0
"of the majority class. Therefore, in this case the point linked by the",0
green-dashed line will be selected since the average distance is smaller.,0
##############################################################################,0
NearMiss-2,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
NearMiss-2 selects samples from the majority class for which the average,0
distance to the farthest neighbors is the smallest. With the same,0
"configuration as previously presented, the sample linked to the green-dashed",0
line will be selected since its distance the 3 farthest neighbors is the,0
smallest.,0

"NearMiss-3 can be divided into 2 steps. First, a nearest-neighbors is used to",0

##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
We use a part of the 20 newsgroups data set by loading 4 topics. Using the,0
"scikit-learn loader, the data are split into a training and a testing set.",0
,0
Note the class \#3 is the minority class and has almost twice less samples,0
than the majority class.,0
##############################################################################,0
The usual scikit-learn pipeline,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
You might usually use scikit-learn pipeline by combining the TF-IDF,0
vectorizer to feed a multinomial naive bayes classifier. A classification,0
report summarized the results on the testing set.,0

"As expected, the recall of the class \#3 is low mainly due to the class",0
imbalanced.,0
##############################################################################,0
Balancing the class before classification,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
"To improve the prediction of the class \#3, it could be interesting to apply",0
"a balancing before to train the naive bayes classifier. Therefore, we will",0
use a ``RandomUnderSampler`` to equalize the number of samples in all the,0
classes before the training.,0
,0
It is also important to note that we are using the ``make_pipeline`` function,0
implemented in imbalanced-learn to properly handle the samplers.,0
##############################################################################,0
"Although the results are almost identical, it can be seen that the resampling",0
allowed to correct the poor recall of the class \#3 at the cost of reducing,0
"the other metrics for the other classes. However, the overall results are",0
slightly better.,0

number of samples between the dataset. It can be seen that with this trivial,0
approach the boundary decision is already less biaised toward the majority,0
class.,0

"Instead of repeating the same samples when over-sampling, we can use some",0
specific heuristic instead. ADASYN and SMOTE can be used in this case.,0
Make an identity sampler,0
##############################################################################,0
The following plot illustrate the difference between ADASYN and SMOTE. ADASYN,0
will focus on the samples which are difficult to classify with a,0
nearest-neighbors rule while regular SMOTE will not make any distinction.,0
"Therefore, the decision function depending of the algorithm.",0
##############################################################################,0
"Due to those sampling particularities, it can give rise to some specific",0
issues as illustrated below.,0
##############################################################################,0
SMOTE proposes several variants by identifying specific samples to consider,0
during the resampling. The borderline version will detect which point to,0
select which are in the border between two classes. The SVM version will use,0
the support vectors found using an SVM algorithm to create new samples.,0

"``SMOTE`` allows to generate samples. However, this method of over-sampling",0
"does not have any knowledge regarding the underlying distribution. Therefore,",0
"some noisy samples can be generated, e.g. when the different classes cannot",0
"be well separated. Hence, it can be beneficial to apply an under-sampling",0
algorithm to clean the noisy samples. Two methods are usually used in the,0
literature: (i) Tomek's link and (ii) edited nearest neighbours cleaning,0
methods. Imbalanced-learn provides two ready-to-use samplers ``SMOTETomek``,0
"and ``SMOTEENN``. In general, ``SMOTEENN`` cleans more noisy data than",0
``SMOTETomek``.,0

Classification using bagging classifier with and without sampling,0
##############################################################################,0
"Instead of using a single tree, we will check if an ensemble of decsion tree",0
"can actually alleviate the issue induced by the class imbalancing. First, we",0
will use a bagging classifier and its counter part which internally uses a,0
random under-sampling to balanced each boostrap sample.,0

Random forest is another popular ensemble method and it is usually,0

Prototype selection: under-sampling by selecting existing samples,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
The algorithm performing prototype selection can be subdivided into two,0
groups: (i) the controlled under-sampling methods and (ii) the cleaning,0
under-sampling methods.,0
##############################################################################,0
"With the controlled under-sampling methods, the number of samples to be",0
selected can be specified. ``RandomUnderSampler`` is the most naive way of,0
performing such selection by randomly selecting a given number of samples by,0
the targetted class.,0
##############################################################################,0
``NearMiss`` algorithms implement some heuristic rules in order to select,0
samples. NearMiss-1 selects samples from the majority class for which the,0
average distance of the :math:`k`` nearest samples of the minority class is,0
the smallest. NearMiss-2 selects the samples from the majority class for,0
which the average distance to the farthest samples of the negative class is,0
"the smallest. NearMiss-3 is a 2-step algorithm: first, for each minority",0
"sample, their ::math:`m` nearest-neighbors will be kept; then, the majority",0
samples selected are the on for which the average distance to the :math:`k`,0
nearest neighbors is the largest.,0
##############################################################################,0
``EditedNearestNeighbours`` removes samples of the majority class for which,0
their class differ from the one of their nearest-neighbors. This sieve can be,0
repeated which is the principle of the,0
``RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbours``. ``AllKNN`` is slightly different from,0
the ``RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbours`` by changing the :math:`k` parameter,0
"of the internal nearest neighors algorithm, increasing it at each iteration.",0
##############################################################################,0
``CondensedNearestNeighbour`` makes use of a 1-NN to iteratively decide if a,0
sample should be kept in a dataset or not. The issue is that,0
``CondensedNearestNeighbour`` is sensitive to noise by preserving the noisy,0
samples. ``OneSidedSelection`` also used the 1-NN and use ``TomekLinks`` to,0
remove the samples considered noisy. The ``NeighbourhoodCleaningRule`` use a,0
"``EditedNearestNeighbours`` to remove some sample. Additionally, they use a 3",0
nearest-neighbors to remove samples which do not agree with this rule.,0
##############################################################################,0
``InstanceHardnessThreshold`` uses the prediction of classifier to exclude,0
samples. All samples which are classified with a low probability will be,0
removed.,0

##############################################################################,0

You might usually use scikit-learn pipeline by combining the TF-IDF,0
vectorizer to feed a multinomial naive bayes classifier. A classification,0
report summarized the results on the testing set.,0

Balancing the class before classification,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
"To improve the prediction of the class \#3, it could be interesting to apply",0
"a balancing before to train the naive bayes classifier. Therefore, we will",0
use a ``RandomUnderSampler`` to equalize the number of samples in all the,0
classes before the training.,0
,0
It is also important to note that we are using the ``make_pipeline`` function,0
implemented in imbalanced-learn to properly handle the samplers.,0
##############################################################################,0
"Although the results are almost identical, it can be seen that the resampling",0
allowed to correct the poor recall of the class \#3 at the cost of reducing,0
"the other metrics for the other classes. However, the overall results are",0
slightly better.,0

Random over-sampling to balance the data set,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
Random over-sampling can be used to repeat some samples and balance the,0
number of samples between the dataset. It can be seen that with this trivial,0
approach the boundary decision is already less biaised toward the majority,0
class.,0
##############################################################################,0

"``SMOTE`` allows to generate samples. However, this method of over-sampling",0
"does not have any knowledge regarding the underlying distribution. Therefore,",0
"some noisy samples can be generated, e.g. when the different classes cannot",0
"be well separated. Hence, it can be beneficial to apply an under-sampling",0
algorithm to clean the noisy samples. Two methods are usually used in the,0
literature: (i) Tomek's link and (ii) edited nearest neighbours cleaning,0
methods. Imbalanced-learn provides two ready-to-use samplers ``SMOTETomek``,0
"and ``SMOTEENN``. In general, ``SMOTEENN`` cleans more noisy data than",0
``SMOTETomek``.,0

"Instead of using a single tree, we will check if an ensemble of decsion tree",0

will use a bagging classifier and its counter part which internally uses a,0

Prototype selection: under-sampling by selecting existing samples,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
The algorithm performing prototype selection can be subdivided into two,0
groups: (i) the controlled under-sampling methods and (ii) the cleaning,0
under-sampling methods.,0
##############################################################################,0
"With the controlled under-sampling methods, the number of samples to be",0
selected can be specified. ``RandomUnderSampler`` is the most naive way of,0
performing such selection by randomly selecting a given number of samples by,0
the targetted class.,0
##############################################################################,0
``NearMiss`` algorithms implement some heuristic rules in order to select,0
samples. NearMiss-1 selects samples from the majority class for which the,0
average distance of the :math:`k`` nearest samples of the minority class is,0
the smallest. NearMiss-2 selects the samples from the majority class for,0
which the average distance to the farthest samples of the negative class is,0
"the smallest. NearMiss-3 is a 2-step algorithm: first, for each minority",0
"sample, their ::math:`m` nearest-neighbors will be kept; then, the majority",0
samples selected are the on for which the average distance to the :math:`k`,0
nearest neighbors is the largest.,0
##############################################################################,0
``EditedNearestNeighbours`` removes samples of the majority class for which,0
their class differ from the one of their nearest-neighbors. This sieve can be,0
repeated which is the principle of the,0
``RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbours``. ``AllKNN`` is slightly different from,0
the ``RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbours`` by changing the :math:`k` parameter,0
"of the internal nearest neighors algorithm, increasing it at each iteration.",0
##############################################################################,0
``CondensedNearestNeighbour`` makes use of a 1-NN to iteratively decide if a,0
sample should be kept in a dataset or not. The issue is that,0
``CondensedNearestNeighbour`` is sensitive to noise by preserving the noisy,0
samples. ``OneSidedSelection`` also used the 1-NN and use ``TomekLinks`` to,0
remove the samples considered noisy. The ``NeighbourhoodCleaningRule`` use a,0
"``EditedNearestNeighbours`` to remove some sample. Additionally, they use a 3",0
nearest-neighbors to remove samples which do not agree with this rule.,0
##############################################################################,0
``InstanceHardnessThreshold`` uses the prediction of classifier to exclude,0
samples. All samples which are classified with a low probability will be,0
removed.,0

##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
We will first illustrate the influence of the balancing ratio on some toy,0
data using a linear SVM classifier. Greater is the difference between the,0
"number of samples in each class, poorer are the classfication results.",0
##############################################################################,0
Random over-sampling to balance the data set,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
Random over-sampling can be used to repeat some samples and balance the,0
number of samples between the dataset. It can be seen that with this trivial,0
approach the boundary decision is already less biaised toward the majority,0
class.,0
##############################################################################,0
More advanced over-sampling using ADASYN and SMOTE,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
"Instead of repeating the same samples when over-sampling, we can use some",0
specific heuristic instead. ADASYN and SMOTE can be used in this case.,0
Make an identity sampler,0
##############################################################################,0
The following plot illustrate the difference between ADASYN and SMOTE. ADASYN,0
will focus on the samples which are difficult to classify with a,0
nearest-neighbors rule while regular SMOTE will not make any distinction.,0
"Therefore, the decision function depending of the algorithm.",0
##############################################################################,0
"Due to those sampling particularities, it can give rise to some specific",0
issues as illustrated below.,0
##############################################################################,0
SMOTE proposes several variants by identifying specific samples to consider,0
during the resampling. The borderline version will detect which point to,0
select which are in the border between two classes. The SVM version will use,0
the support vectors found using an SVM algorithm to create new samples.,0

"``SMOTE`` allows to generate samples. However, this method of over-sampling",0

"some noisy samples can be generated, e.g. when the different classes cannot",0
"be well separated. Hence, it can be beneficial to apply an under-sampling",0
algorithm to clean the noisy samples. Two methods are usually used in the,0
literature: (i) Tomek's link and (ii) edited nearest neighbours cleaning,0
methods. Imbalanced-learn provides two ready-to-use samplers ``SMOTETomek``,0
"and ``SMOTEENN``. In general, ``SMOTEENN`` cleans more noisy data than",0
``SMOTETomek``.,0

Classification using bagging classifier with and without sampling,0
##############################################################################,0
"Instead of using a single tree, we will check if an ensemble of decsion tree",0
"can actually alleviate the issue induced by the class imbalancing. First, we",0
will use a bagging classifier and its counter part which internally uses a,0
random under-sampling to balanced each boostrap sample.,0
##############################################################################,0
Balancing each bootstrap sample allows to increase significantly the balanced,0
accuracy and the geometric mean.,0
##############################################################################,0
Classification using random forest classifier with and without sampling,0
##############################################################################,0
Random forest is another popular ensemble method and it is usually,0
"outperforming bagging. Here, we used a vanilla random forest and its balanced",0
counterpart in which each bootstrap sample is balanced.,0
"Similarly to the previous experiment, the balanced classifier outperform the",0
"classifier which learn from imbalanced bootstrap samples. In addition, random",0
forest outsperforms the bagging classifier.,0

##############################################################################,0
Prototype selection: under-sampling by selecting existing samples,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
The algorithm performing prototype selection can be subdivided into two,0
groups: (i) the controlled under-sampling methods and (ii) the cleaning,0
under-sampling methods.,0
##############################################################################,0
"With the controlled under-sampling methods, the number of samples to be",0
selected can be specified. ``RandomUnderSampler`` is the most naive way of,0
performing such selection by randomly selecting a given number of samples by,0
the targetted class.,0
##############################################################################,0
``NearMiss`` algorithms implement some heuristic rules in order to select,0
samples. NearMiss-1 selects samples from the majority class for which the,0
average distance of the :math:`k`` nearest samples of the minority class is,0
the smallest. NearMiss-2 selects the samples from the majority class for,0
which the average distance to the farthest samples of the negative class is,0
"the smallest. NearMiss-3 is a 2-step algorithm: first, for each minority",0
"sample, their ::math:`m` nearest-neighbors will be kept; then, the majority",0
samples selected are the on for which the average distance to the :math:`k`,0
nearest neighbors is the largest.,0
##############################################################################,0
``EditedNearestNeighbours`` removes samples of the majority class for which,0
their class differ from the one of their nearest-neighbors. This sieve can be,0
repeated which is the principle of the,0
``RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbours``. ``AllKNN`` is slightly different from,0
the ``RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbours`` by changing the :math:`k` parameter,0
"of the internal nearest neighors algorithm, increasing it at each iteration.",0
##############################################################################,0
``CondensedNearestNeighbour`` makes use of a 1-NN to iteratively decide if a,0
sample should be kept in a dataset or not. The issue is that,0
``CondensedNearestNeighbour`` is sensitive to noise by preserving the noisy,0
samples. ``OneSidedSelection`` also used the 1-NN and use ``TomekLinks`` to,0
remove the samples considered noisy. The ``NeighbourhoodCleaningRule`` use a,0
"``EditedNearestNeighbours`` to remove some sample. Additionally, they use a 3",0
nearest-neighbors to remove samples which do not agree with this rule.,0
##############################################################################,0
``InstanceHardnessThreshold`` uses the prediction of classifier to exclude,0
samples. All samples which are classified with a low probability will be,0
removed.,0

We can run the ``TomekLinks`` sampling to remove the corresponding,0
samples. If ``sampling_strategy='auto'`` only the sample from the majority,0

removed.,0

"example, we use a 3-NN to compute the average distance on 2 specific samples",0
"of the majority class. Therefore, in this case the point linked by the",0
green-dashed line will be selected since the average distance is smaller.,0
##############################################################################,0

##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
NearMiss-2 selects samples from the majority class for which the average,0

##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
"To improve the prediction of the class \#3, it could be interesting to apply",0
"a balancing before to train the naive bayes classifier. Therefore, we will",0
use a ``RandomUnderSampler`` to equalize the number of samples in all the,0
classes before the training.,0

It is also important to note that we are using the ``make_pipeline`` function,0
implemented in imbalanced-learn to properly handle the samplers.,0
##############################################################################,0
"Although the results are almost identical, it can be seen that the resampling",0
allowed to correct the poor recall of the class \#3 at the cost of reducing,0

##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
We will first illustrate the influence of the balancing ratio on some toy,0

"number of samples in each class, poorer are the classfication results.",0
##############################################################################,0
Random over-sampling to balance the data set,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
Random over-sampling can be used to repeat some samples and balance the,0
number of samples between the dataset. It can be seen that with this trivial,0
approach the boundary decision is already less biaised toward the majority,0
class.,0
##############################################################################,0
More advanced over-sampling using ADASYN and SMOTE,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
"Instead of repeating the same samples when over-sampling, we can use some",0
specific heuristic instead. ADASYN and SMOTE can be used in this case.,0
Make an identity sampler,0
##############################################################################,0
The following plot illustrate the difference between ADASYN and SMOTE. ADASYN,0
will focus on the samples which are difficult to classify with a,0
nearest-neighbors rule while regular SMOTE will not make any distinction.,0
"Therefore, the decision function depending of the algorithm.",0

##############################################################################,0
SMOTE proposes several variants by identifying specific samples to consider,0
during the resampling. The borderline version will detect which point to,0
select which are in the border between two classes. The SVM version will use,0
the support vectors found using an SVM algorithm to create new samples.,0

"``SMOTE`` allows to generate samples. However, this method of over-sampling",0

"some noisy samples can be generated, e.g. when the different classes cannot",0
"be well separated. Hence, it can be beneficial to apply an under-sampling",0
algorithm to clean the noisy samples. Two methods are usually used in the,0
literature: (i) Tomek's link and (ii) edited nearest neighbours cleaning,0
methods. Imbalanced-learn provides two ready-to-use samplers ``SMOTETomek``,0
"and ``SMOTEENN``. In general, ``SMOTEENN`` cleans more noisy data than",0
``SMOTETomek``.,0

Classification using bagging classifier with and without sampling,0
##############################################################################,0
"Instead of using a single tree, we will check if an ensemble of decsion tree",0
"can actually alleviate the issue induced by the class imbalancing. First, we",0
will use a bagging classifier and its counter part which internally uses a,0
random under-sampling to balanced each boostrap sample.,0
##############################################################################,0
Balancing each bootstrap sample allows to increase significantly the balanced,0
accuracy and the geometric mean.,0
##############################################################################,0
Classification using random forest classifier with and without sampling,0
##############################################################################,0
Random forest is another popular ensemble method and it is usually,0
"outperforming bagging. Here, we used a vanilla random forest and its balanced",0
counterpart in which each bootstrap sample is balanced.,0

forest outsperforms the bagging classifier.,0

Prototype selection: under-sampling by selecting existing samples,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
The algorithm performing prototype selection can be subdivided into two,0
groups: (i) the controlled under-sampling methods and (ii) the cleaning,0
under-sampling methods.,0
##############################################################################,0
"With the controlled under-sampling methods, the number of samples to be",0
selected can be specified. ``RandomUnderSampler`` is the most naive way of,0
performing such selection by randomly selecting a given number of samples by,0
the targetted class.,0
##############################################################################,0
``NearMiss`` algorithms implement some heuristic rules in order to select,0
samples. NearMiss-1 selects samples from the majority class for which the,0
average distance of the :math:`k`` nearest samples of the minority class is,0
the smallest. NearMiss-2 selects the samples from the majority class for,0
which the average distance to the farthest samples of the negative class is,0
"the smallest. NearMiss-3 is a 2-step algorithm: first, for each minority",0
"sample, their ::math:`m` nearest-neighbors will be kept; then, the majority",0
samples selected are the on for which the average distance to the :math:`k`,0
nearest neighbors is the largest.,0
##############################################################################,0
``EditedNearestNeighbours`` removes samples of the majority class for which,0
their class differ from the one of their nearest-neighbors. This sieve can be,0
repeated which is the principle of the,0
``RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbours``. ``AllKNN`` is slightly different from,0
the ``RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbours`` by changing the :math:`k` parameter,0
"of the internal nearest neighors algorithm, increasing it at each iteration.",0
##############################################################################,0
``CondensedNearestNeighbour`` makes use of a 1-NN to iteratively decide if a,0
sample should be kept in a dataset or not. The issue is that,0
``CondensedNearestNeighbour`` is sensitive to noise by preserving the noisy,0
samples. ``OneSidedSelection`` also used the 1-NN and use ``TomekLinks`` to,0
remove the samples considered noisy. The ``NeighbourhoodCleaningRule`` use a,0
"``EditedNearestNeighbours`` to remove some sample. Additionally, they use a 3",0
nearest-neighbors to remove samples which do not agree with this rule.,0
##############################################################################,0
``InstanceHardnessThreshold`` uses the prediction of classifier to exclude,0
samples. All samples which are classified with a low probability will be,0
removed.,0

We can run the ``TomekLinks`` sampling to remove the corresponding,0
samples. If ``sampling_strategy='auto'`` only the sample from the majority,0

"example, we use a 3-NN to compute the average distance on 2 specific samples",0
"of the majority class. Therefore, in this case the point linked by the",0
green-dashed line will be selected since the average distance is smaller.,0

Balancing the class before classification,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
"To improve the prediction of the class \#3, it could be interesting to apply",0
"a balancing before to train the naive bayes classifier. Therefore, we will",0
use a ``RandomUnderSampler`` to equalize the number of samples in all the,0
classes before the training.,0
,0
It is also important to note that we are using the ``make_pipeline`` function,0
implemented in imbalanced-learn to properly handle the samplers.,0
##############################################################################,0
"Although the results are almost identical, it can be seen that the resampling",0
allowed to correct the poor recall of the class \#3 at the cost of reducing,0
"the other metrics for the other classes. However, the overall results are",0
slightly better.,0

Creation of an imbalanced data set from a balanced data set,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
We will show how to use the parameter ``ratio`` when dealing with the,0
"``make_imbalance`` function. For this function, this parameter accepts both",0
"dictionary and callable. When using a dictionary, each key will correspond to",0
the class of interest and the corresponding value will be the number of,0
samples desired in this class.,0
##############################################################################,0
You might required more flexibility and require your own heuristic to,0
determine the number of samples by class and you can define your own callable,0
as follow. In this case we will define a function which will use a float,0
multiplier to define the number of samples per class.,0
##############################################################################,0

##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
"In all sampling algorithms, ``ratio`` can be used as illustrated earlier. In",0

"minority'``: resample all classes apart of the minority class, (iv)",0
"``'all'``: resample all classes, and (v) ``'auto'``: correspond to 'all' with",0
for over-sampling methods and 'not minority' for under-sampling methods. The,0
classes targeted will be over-sampled or under-sampled to achieve an equal,0
number of sample with the majority or minority class.,0

Random over-sampling to balance the data set,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
Random over-sampling can be used to repeat some samples and balance the,0
number of samples between the dataset. It can be seen that with this trivial,0
approach the boundary decision is already less biaised toward the majority,0
class.,0
##############################################################################,0

"Instead of repeating the same samples when over-sampling, we can use some",0
specific heuristic instead. ADASYN and SMOTE can be used in this case.,0

##############################################################################,0
The following plot illustrate the difference between ADASYN and SMOTE. ADASYN,0
will focus on the samples which are difficult to classify with a,0
nearest-neighbors rule while regular SMOTE will not make any distinction.,0
"Therefore, the decision function depending of the algorithm.",0
##############################################################################,0
"Due to those sampling particularities, it can give rise to some specific",0
issues as illustrated below.,0
##############################################################################,0
SMOTE proposes several variants by identifying specific samples to consider,0
during the resampling. The borderline version will detect which point to,0
select which are in the border between two classes. The SVM version will use,0
the support vectors found using an SVM algorithm to create new samples.,0

"``SMOTE`` allows to generate samples. However, this method of over-sampling",0
"does not have any knowledge regarding the underlying distribution. Therefore,",0
"some noisy samples can be generated, e.g. when the different classes cannot",0
"be well separated. Hence, it can be beneficial to apply an under-sampling",0
algorithm to clean the noisy samples. Two methods are usually used in the,0
literature: (i) Tomek's link and (ii) edited nearest neighbours cleaning,0
methods. Imbalanced-learn provides two ready-to-use samplers ``SMOTETomek``,0
"and ``SMOTEENN``. In general, ``SMOTEENN`` cleans more noisy data than",0
``SMOTETomek``.,0

##############################################################################,0
Prototype selection: under-sampling by selecting existing samples,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
The algorithm performing prototype selection can be subdivided into two,0
groups: (i) the controlled under-sampling methods and (ii) the cleaning,0
under-sampling methods.,0
##############################################################################,0
"With the controlled under-sampling methods, the number of samples to be",0
selected can be specified. ``RandomUnderSampler`` is the most naive way of,0
performing such selection by randomly selecting a given number of samples by,0
the targetted class.,0
##############################################################################,0
``NearMiss`` algorithms implement some heuristic rules in order to select,0
samples. NearMiss-1 selects samples from the majority class for which the,0
average distance of the :math:`k`` nearest samples of the minority class is,0
the smallest. NearMiss-2 selects the samples from the majority class for,0
which the average distance to the farthest samples of the negative class is,0
"the smallest. NearMiss-3 is a 2-step algorithm: first, for each minority",0
"sample, their ::math:`m` nearest-neighbors will be kept; then, the majority",0
samples selected are the on for which the average distance to the :math:`k`,0
nearest neighbors is the largest.,0
##############################################################################,0
``EditedNearestNeighbours`` removes samples of the majority class for which,0
their class differ from the one of their nearest-neighbors. This sieve can be,0
repeated which is the principle of the,0
``RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbours``. ``AllKNN`` is slightly different from,0
the ``RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbours`` by changing the :math:`k` parameter,0
"of the internal nearest neighors algorithm, increasing it at each iteration.",0
##############################################################################,0
``CondensedNearestNeighbour`` makes use of a 1-NN to iteratively decide if a,0
sample should be kept in a dataset or not. The issue is that,0
``CondensedNearestNeighbour`` is sensitive to noise by preserving the noisy,0
samples. ``OneSidedSelection`` also used the 1-NN and use ``TomekLinks`` to,0
remove the samples considered noisy. The ``NeighbourhoodCleaningRule`` use a,0
"``EditedNearestNeighbours`` to remove some sample. Additionally, they use a 3",0
nearest-neighbors to remove samples which do not agree with this rule.,0

samples. All samples which are classified with a low probability will be,0
removed.,0

Creation of an imbalanced data set from a balanced data set,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
We will show how to use the parameter ``ratio`` when dealing with the,0
"``make_imbalance`` function. For this function, this parameter accepts both",0
"dictionary and callable. When using a dictionary, each key will correspond to",0
the class of interest and the corresponding value will be the number of,0
samples desired in this class.,0
##############################################################################,0
You might required more flexibility and require your own heuristic to,0
determine the number of samples by class and you can define your own callable,0
as follow. In this case we will define a function which will use a float,0
multiplier to define the number of samples per class.,0
##############################################################################,0
Using ``ratio`` in resampling algorithm,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
"In all sampling algorithms, ``ratio`` can be used as illustrated earlier. In",0
"addition, some predefined functions are available and can be executed using a",0
``str`` with the following choices: (i) ``'minority'``: resample the minority,0
"class; (ii) ``'majority'``: resample the majority class, (iii) ``'not",0
"minority'``: resample all classes apart of the minority class, (iv)",0
"``'all'``: resample all classes, and (v) ``'auto'``: correspond to 'all' with",0
for over-sampling methods and 'not minority' for under-sampling methods. The,0
classes targeted will be over-sampled or under-sampled to achieve an equal,0
number of sample with the majority or minority class.,0

Random over-sampling to balance the data set,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
Random over-sampling can be used to repeat some samples and balance the,0
number of samples between the dataset. It can be seen that with this trivial,0
approach the boundary decision is already less biaised toward the majority,0
class.,0
##############################################################################,0
More advanced over-sampling using ADASYN and SMOTE,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
"Instead of repeating the same samples when over-sampling, we can use some",0
specific heuristic instead. ADASYN and SMOTE can be used in this case.,0
Make an identity sampler,0
##############################################################################,0
The following plot illustrate the difference between ADASYN and SMOTE. ADASYN,0
will focus on the samples which are difficult to classify with a,0
nearest-neighbors rule while regular SMOTE will not make any distinction.,0
"Therefore, the decision function depending of the algorithm.",0
##############################################################################,0
"Due to those sampling particularities, it can give rise to some specific",0
issues as illustrated below.,0
##############################################################################,0
SMOTE proposes several variants by identifying specific samples to consider,0
during the resampling. The borderline version will detect which point to,0
select which are in the border between two classes. The SVM version will use,0
the support vectors found using an SVM algorithm to create new samples.,0

"``SMOTE`` allows to generate samples. However, this method of over-sampling",0
"does not have any knowledge regarding the underlying distribution. Therefore,",0
"some noisy samples can be generated, e.g. when the different classes cannot",0
"be well separated. Hence, it can be beneficial to apply an under-sampling",0
algorithm to clean the noisy samples. Two methods are usually used in the,0
literature: (i) Tomek's link and (ii) edited nearest neighbours cleaning,0
methods. Imbalanced-learn provides two ready-to-use samplers ``SMOTETomek``,0
"and ``SMOTEENN``. In general, ``SMOTEENN`` cleans more noisy data than",0
``SMOTETomek``.,0

Prototype generation: under-sampling by generating new samples,0

centroids of the cluster found.,0
##############################################################################,0
Prototype selection: under-sampling by selecting existing samples,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
The algorithm performing prototype selection can be subdivided into two,0
groups: (i) the controlled under-sampling methods and (ii) the cleaning,0
under-sampling methods.,0
##############################################################################,0
"With the controlled under-sampling methods, the number of samples to be",0
selected can be specified. ``RandomUnderSampler`` is the most naive way of,0
performing such selection by randomly selecting a given number of samples by,0
the targetted class.,0
##############################################################################,0
``NearMiss`` algorithms implement some heuristic rules in order to select,0
samples. NearMiss-1 selects samples from the majority class for which the,0
average distance of the :math:`k`` nearest samples of the minority class is,0
the smallest. NearMiss-2 selects the samples from the majority class for,0
which the average distance to the farthest samples of the negative class is,0
"the smallest. NearMiss-3 is a 2-step algorithm: first, for each minority",0
"sample, their ::math:`m` nearest-neighbors will be kept; then, the majority",0
samples selected are the on for which the average distance to the :math:`k`,0
nearest neighbors is the largest.,0
##############################################################################,0
``EditedNearestNeighbours`` removes samples of the majority class for which,0
their class differ from the one of their nearest-neighbors. This sieve can be,0
repeated which is the principle of the,0
``RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbours``. ``AllKNN`` is slightly different from,0
the ``RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbours`` by changing the :math:`k` parameter,0
"of the internal nearest neighors algorithm, increasing it at each iteration.",0
##############################################################################,0
``CondensedNearestNeighbour`` makes use of a 1-NN to iteratively decide if a,0
sample should be kept in a dataset or not. The issue is that,0
``CondensedNearestNeighbour`` is sensitive to noise by preserving the noisy,0
samples. ``OneSidedSelection`` also used the 1-NN and use ``TomekLinks`` to,0
remove the samples considered noisy. The ``NeighbourhoodCleaningRule`` use a,0
"``EditedNearestNeighbours`` to remove some sample. Additionally, they use a 3",0
nearest-neighbors to remove samples which do not agree with this rule.,0
##############################################################################,0
``InstanceHardnessThreshold`` uses the prediction of classifier to exclude,0
samples. All samples which are classified with a low probability will be,0
removed.,0

Setting the data set,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
We use a part of the 20 newsgroups data set by loading 4 topics. Using the,0
"scikit-learn loader, the data are split into a training and a testing set.",0
,0
Note the class \#3 is the minority class and has almost twice less samples,0
than the majority class.,0
##############################################################################,0
The usual scikit-learn pipeline,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
You might usually use scikit-learn pipeline by combining the TF-IDF,0
vectorizer to feed a multinomial naive bayes classifier. A classification,0
report summarized the results on the testing set.,0
,0
"As expected, the recall of the class \#3 is low mainly due to the class",0
imbalanced.,0
##############################################################################,0
Balancing the class before classification,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
"To improve the prediction of the class \#3, it could be interesting to apply",0
"a balancing before to train the naive bayes classifier. Therefore, we will",0
use a ``RandomUnderSampler`` to equalize the number of samples in all the,0
classes before the training.,0
,0
It is also important to note that we are using the ``make_pipeline`` function,0
implemented in imbalanced-learn to properly handle the samplers.,0
##############################################################################,0
"Although the results are almost identical, it can be seen that the resampling",0
allowed to correct the poor recall of the class \#3 at the cost of reducing,0
"the other metrics for the other classes. However, the overall results are",0
slightly better.,0

Creation of an imbalanced data set from a balanced data set,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
We will show how to use the parameter ``ratio`` when dealing with the,0
"``make_imbalance`` function. For this function, this parameter accepts both",0
"dictionary and callable. When using a dictionary, each key will correspond to",0
the class of interest and the corresponding value will be the number of,0
samples desired in this class.,0
##############################################################################,0
You might required more flexibility and require your own heuristic to,0
determine the number of samples by class and you can define your own callable,0
as follow. In this case we will define a function which will use a float,0
multiplier to define the number of samples per class.,0

##############################################################################,0

"In all sampling algorithms, ``ratio`` can be used as illustrated earlier. In",0

"minority'``: resample all classes apart of the minority class, (iv)",0
"``'all'``: resample all classes, and (v) ``'auto'``: correspond to 'all' with",0
for over-sampling methods and 'not minority' for under-sampling methods. The,0
classes targeted will be over-sampled or under-sampled to achieve an equal,0
number of sample with the majority or minority class.,0

Random over-sampling to balance the data set,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
Random over-sampling can be used to repeat some samples and balance the,0
number of samples between the dataset. It can be seen that with this trivial,0
approach the boundary decision is already less biaised toward the majority,0
class.,0
##############################################################################,0
More advanced over-sampling using ADASYN and SMOTE,0
##############################################################################,0

"Instead of repeating the same samples when over-sampling, we can use some",0
specific heuristic instead. ADASYN and SMOTE can be used in this case.,0
Make an identity sampler,0
##############################################################################,0
The following plot illustrate the difference between ADASYN and SMOTE. ADASYN,0
will focus on the samples which are difficult to classify with a,0
nearest-neighbors rule while regular SMOTE will not make any distinction.,0
"Therefore, the decision function depending of the algorithm.",0
##############################################################################,0
"Due to those sampling particularities, it can give rise to some specific",0
issues as illustrated below.,0
##############################################################################,0
SMOTE proposes several variants by identifying specific samples to consider,0
during the resampling. The borderline version will detect which point to,0
select which are in the border between two classes. The SVM version will use,0
the support vectors found using an SVM algorithm to create new samples.,0

"``SMOTE`` allows to generate samples. However, this method of over-sampling",0
"does not have any knowledge regarding the underlying distribution. Therefore,",0
"some noisy samples can be generated, e.g. when the different classes cannot",0
"be well separated. Hence, it can be beneficial to apply an under-sampling",0
algorithm to clean the noisy samples. Two methods are usually used in the,0
literature: (i) Tomek's link and (ii) edited nearest neighbours cleaning,0
methods. Imbalanced-learn provides two ready-to-use samplers ``SMOTETomek``,0
"and ``SMOTEENN``. In general, ``SMOTEENN`` cleans more noisy data than",0
``SMOTETomek``.,0

centroids of the cluster found.,0
##############################################################################,0
Prototype selection: under-sampling by selecting existing samples,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
The algorithm performing prototype selection can be subdivided into two,0
groups: (i) the controlled under-sampling methods and (ii) the cleaning,0
under-sampling methods.,0
##############################################################################,0
"With the controlled under-sampling methods, the number of samples to be",0
selected can be specified. ``RandomUnderSampler`` is the most naive way of,0
performing such selection by randomly selecting a given number of samples by,0
the targetted class.,0
##############################################################################,0
``NearMiss`` algorithms implement some heuristic rules in order to select,0
samples. NearMiss-1 selects samples from the majority class for which the,0
average distance of the :math:`k`` nearest samples of the minority class is,0
the smallest. NearMiss-2 selects the samples from the majority class for,0
which the average distance to the farthest samples of the negative class is,0
"the smallest. NearMiss-3 is a 2-step algorithm: first, for each minority",0
"sample, their ::math:`m` nearest-neighbors will be kept; then, the majority",0
samples selected are the on for which the average distance to the :math:`k`,0
nearest neighbors is the largest.,0
##############################################################################,0
``EditedNearestNeighbours`` removes samples of the majority class for which,0
their class differ from the one of their nearest-neighbors. This sieve can be,0
repeated which is the principle of the,0
``RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbours``. ``AllKNN`` is slightly different from,0
the ``RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbours`` by changing the :math:`k` parameter,0
"of the internal nearest neighors algorithm, increasing it at each iteration.",0
##############################################################################,0
``CondensedNearestNeighbour`` makes use of a 1-NN to iteratively decide if a,0
sample should be kept in a dataset or not. The issue is that,0
``CondensedNearestNeighbour`` is sensitive to noise by preserving the noisy,0
samples. ``OneSidedSelection`` also used the 1-NN and use ``TomekLinks`` to,0
remove the samples considered noisy. The ``NeighbourhoodCleaningRule`` use a,0
"``EditedNearestNeighbours`` to remove some sample. Additionally, they use a 3",0
nearest-neighbors to remove samples which do not agree with this rule.,0
##############################################################################,0
``InstanceHardnessThreshold`` uses the prediction of classifier to exclude,0
samples. All samples which are classified with a low probability will be,0
removed.,0

Setting the data set,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
We use a part of the 20 newsgroups data set by loading 4 topics. Using the,0
"scikit-learn loader, the data are split into a training and a testing set.",0
,0
Note the class \#3 is the minority class and has almost twice less samples,0
than the majority class.,0
##############################################################################,0
The usual scikit-learn pipeline,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
You might usually use scikit-learn pipeline by combining the TF-IDF,0
vectorizer to feed a multinomial naive bayes classifier. A classification,0
report summarized the results on the testing set.,0
,0
"As expected, the recall of the class \#3 is low mainly due to the class",0
imbalanced.,0
##############################################################################,0
Balancing the class before classification,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
"To improve the prediction of the class \#3, it could be interesting to apply",0
"a balancing before to train the naive bayes classifier. Therefore, we will",0
use a ``RandomUnderSampler`` to equalize the number of samples in all the,0
classes before the training.,0
,0
It is also important to note that we are using the ``make_pipeline`` function,0
implemented in imbalanced-learn to properly handle the samplers.,0
##############################################################################,0
"Although the results are almost identical, it can be seen that the resampling",0
allowed to correct the poor recall of the class \#3 at the cost of reducing,0
"the other metrics for the other classes. However, the overall results are",0
slightly better.,0

Creation of an imbalanced data set from a balanced data set,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
We will show how to use the parameter ``ratio`` when dealing with the,0
"``make_imbalance`` function. For this function, this parameter accepts both",0
"dictionary and callable. When using a dictionary, each key will correspond to",0
the class of interest and the corresponding value will be the number of,0
samples desired in this class.,0
##############################################################################,0
You might required more flexibility and require your own heuristic to,0
determine the number of samples by class and you can define your own callable,0
as follow. In this case we will define a function which will use a float,0
multiplier to define the number of samples per class.,0
##############################################################################,0
Using ``ratio`` in resampling algorithm,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
"In all sampling algorithms, ``ratio`` can be used as illustrated earlier. In",0
"addition, some predefined functions are available and can be executed using a",0
``str`` with the following choices: (i) ``'minority'``: resample the minority,0
"class; (ii) ``'majority'``: resample the majority class, (iii) ``'not",0
"minority'``: resample all classes apart of the minority class, (iv)",0
"``'all'``: resample all classes, and (v) ``'auto'``: correspond to 'all' with",0
for over-sampling methods and 'not minority' for under-sampling methods. The,0
classes targeted will be over-sampled or under-sampled to achieve an equal,0
number of sample with the majority or minority class.,0

##############################################################################,0

Random over-sampling to balance the data set,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
Random over-sampling can be used to repeat some samples and balance the,0
number of samples between the dataset. It can be seen that with this trivial,0
approach the boundary decision is already less biaised toward the majority,0
class.,0
##############################################################################,0
More advanced over-sampling using ADASYN and SMOTE,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
"Instead of repeating the same samples when over-sampling, we can use some",0
specific heuristic instead. ADASYN and SMOTE can be used in this case.,0
Make an identity sampler,0
##############################################################################,0
The following plot illustrate the difference between ADASYN and SMOTE. ADASYN,0
will focus on the samples which are difficult to classify with a,0
nearest-neighbors rule while regular SMOTE will not make any distinction.,0
"Therefore, the decision function depending of the algorithm.",0
##############################################################################,0
"Due to those sampling particularities, it can give rise to some specific",0
issues as illustrated below.,0
##############################################################################,0
SMOTE proposes several variants by identifying specific samples to consider,0
during the resampling. The borderline version will detect which point to,0
select which are in the border between two classes. The SVM version will use,0
the support vectors found using an SVM algorithm to create new samples.,0

"``SMOTE`` allows to generate samples. However, this method of over-sampling",0
"does not have any knowledge regarding the underlying distribution. Therefore,",0
"some noisy samples can be generated, e.g. when the different classes cannot",0
"be well separated. Hence, it can be beneficial to apply an under-sampling",0
algorithm to clean the noisy samples. Two methods are usually used in the,0
literature: (i) Tomek's link and (ii) edited nearest neighbours cleaning,0
methods. Imbalanced-learn provides two ready-to-use samplers ``SMOTETomek``,0
"and ``SMOTEENN``. In general, ``SMOTEENN`` cleans more noisy data than",0
``SMOTETomek``.,0

Prototype generation: under-sampling by generating new samples,0
##############################################################################,0

``ClusterCentroids`` under-samples by replacing the original samples by the,0
centroids of the cluster found.,0
##############################################################################,0
Prototype selection: under-sampling by selecting existing samples,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
The algorithm performing prototype selection can be subdivided into two,0
groups: (i) the controlled under-sampling methods and (ii) the cleaning,0
under-sampling methods.,0
##############################################################################,0
"With the controlled under-sampling methods, the number of samples to be",0
selected can be specified. ``RandomUnderSampler`` is the most naive way of,0
performing such selection by randomly selecting a given number of samples by,0
the targetted class.,0
##############################################################################,0
``NearMiss`` algorithms implement some heuristic rules in order to select,0
samples. NearMiss-1 selects samples from the majority class for which the,0
average distance of the :math:`k`` nearest samples of the minority class is,0
the smallest. NearMiss-2 selects the samples from the majority class for,0
which the average distance to the farthest samples of the negative class is,0
"the smallest. NearMiss-3 is a 2-step algorithm: first, for each minority",0
"sample, their ::math:`m` nearest-neighbors will be kept; then, the majority",0
samples selected are the on for which the average distance to the :math:`k`,0
nearest neighbors is the largest.,0
##############################################################################,0
``EditedNearestNeighbours`` removes samples of the majority class for which,0
their class differ from the one of their nearest-neighbors. This sieve can be,0
repeated which is the principle of the,0
``RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbours``. ``AllKNN`` is slightly different from,0
the ``RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbours`` by changing the :math:`k` parameter,0
"of the internal nearest neighors algorithm, increasing it at each iteration.",0
##############################################################################,0
``CondensedNearestNeighbour`` makes use of a 1-NN to iteratively decide if a,0
sample should be kept in a dataset or not. The issue is that,0
``CondensedNearestNeighbour`` is sensitive to noise by preserving the noisy,0
samples. ``OneSidedSelection`` also used the 1-NN and use ``TomekLinks`` to,0
remove the samples considered noisy. The ``NeighbourhoodCleaningRule`` use a,0
"``EditedNearestNeighbours`` to remove some sample. Additionally, they use a 3",0
nearest-neighbors to remove samples which do not agree with this rule.,0
##############################################################################,0
``InstanceHardnessThreshold`` uses the prediction of classifier to exclude,0
samples. All samples which are classified with a low probability will be,0
removed.,0

Setting the data set,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
We use a part of the 20 newsgroups data set by loading 4 topics. Using the,0
"scikit-learn loader, the data are split into a training and a testing set.",0
,0
Note the class \#3 is the minority class and has almost twice less samples,0
than the majority class.,0
##############################################################################,0
The usual scikit-learn pipeline,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
You might usually use scikit-learn pipeline by combining the TF-IDF,0
vectorizer to feed a multinomial naive bayes classifier. A classification,0
report summarized the results on the testing set.,0
,0
"As expected, the recall of the class \#3 is low mainly due to the class",0
imbalanced.,0
##############################################################################,0
Balancing the class before classification,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
"To improve the prediction of the class \#3, it could be interesting to apply",0
"a balancing before to train the naive bayes classifier. Therefore, we will",0
use a ``RandomUnderSampler`` to equalize the number of samples in all the,0
classes before the training.,0
,0
It is also important to note that we are using the ``make_pipeline`` function,0
implemented in imbalanced-learn to properly handle the samplers.,0
##############################################################################,0
"Although the results are almost identical, it can be seen that the resampling",0
allowed to correct the poor recall of the class \#3 at the cost of reducing,0
"the other metrics for the other classes. However, the overall results are",0
slightly better.,0

Creation of an imbalanced data set from a balanced data set,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
We will show how to use the parameter ``ratio`` when dealing with the,0
"``make_imbalance`` function. For this function, this parameter accepts both",0
"dictionary and callable. When using a dictionary, each key will correspond to",0
the class of interest and the corresponding value will be the number of,0
samples desired in this class.,0
##############################################################################,0
You might required more flexibility and require your own heuristic to,0
determine the number of samples by class and you can define your own callable,0
as follow. In this case we will define a function which will use a float,0
multiplier to define the number of samples per class.,0

"In all sampling algorithms, ``ratio`` can be used as illustrated earlier. In",0

"minority'``: resample all classes apart of the minority class, (iv)",0
"``'all'``: resample all classes, and (v) ``'auto'``: correspond to 'all' with",0
for over-sampling methods and 'not minority' for under-sampling methods. The,0
classes targeted will be over-sampled or under-sampled to achieve an equal,0
number of sample with the majority or minority class.,0

Random over-sampling to balance the data set,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
Random over-sampling can be used to repeat some samples and balance the,0
number of samples between the dataset. It can be seen that with this trivial,0
approach the boundary decision is already less biaised toward the majority,0
class.,0
##############################################################################,0
More advanced over-sampling using ADASYN and SMOTE,0
##############################################################################,0

"Instead of repeating the same samples when over-sampling, we can use some",0
specific heuristic instead. ADASYN and SMOTE can be used in this case.,0
Make an identity sampler,0
##############################################################################,0
The following plot illustrate the difference between ADASYN and SMOTE. ADASYN,0
will focus on the samples which are difficult to classify with a,0
nearest-neighbors rule while regular SMOTE will not make any distinction.,0
"Therefore, the decision function depending of the algorithm.",0
##############################################################################,0
"Due to those sampling particularities, it can give rise to some specific",0
issues as illustrated below.,0
##############################################################################,0
SMOTE proposes several variants by identifying specific samples to consider,0
during the resampling. The borderline version will detect which point to,0
select which are in the border between two classes. The SVM version will use,0
the support vectors found using an SVM algorithm to create new samples.,0

"``SMOTE`` allows to generate samples. However, this method of over-sampling",0
"does not have any knowledge regarding the underlying distribution. Therefore,",0
"some noisy samples can be generated, e.g. when the different classes cannot",0
"be well separated. Hence, it can be beneficial to apply an under-sampling",0
algorithm to clean the noisy samples. Two methods are usually used in the,0
literature: (i) Tomek's link and (ii) edited nearest neighbours cleaning,0
methods. Imbalanced-learn provides two ready-to-use samplers ``SMOTETomek``,0

##############################################################################,0
Prototype selection: under-sampling by selecting existing samples,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
The algorithm performing prototype selection can be subdivided into two,0
groups: (i) the controlled under-sampling methods and (ii) the cleaning,0
under-sampling methods.,0
##############################################################################,0
"With the controlled under-sampling methods, the number of samples to be",0
selected can be specified. ``RandomUnderSampler`` is the most naive way of,0
performing such selection by randomly selecting a given number of samples by,0
the targetted class.,0
##############################################################################,0
``NearMiss`` algorithms implement some heuristic rules in order to select,0
samples. NearMiss-1 selects samples from the majority class for which the,0
average distance of the :math:`k`` nearest samples of the minority class is,0
the smallest. NearMiss-2 selects the samples from the majority class for,0
which the average distance to the farthest samples of the negative class is,0
"the smallest. NearMiss-3 is a 2-step algorithm: first, for each minority",0
"sample, their ::math:`m` nearest-neighbors will be kept; then, the majority",0
samples selected are the on for which the average distance to the :math:`k`,0
nearest neighbors is the largest.,0
##############################################################################,0
``EditedNearestNeighbours`` removes samples of the majority class for which,0
their class differ from the one of their nearest-neighbors. This sieve can be,0
repeated which is the principle of the,0
``RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbours``. ``AllKNN`` is slightly different from,0
the ``RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbours`` by changing the :math:`k` parameter,0
"of the internal nearest neighors algorithm, increasing it at each iteration.",0
##############################################################################,0
``CondensedNearestNeighbour`` makes use of a 1-NN to iteratively decide if a,0
sample should be kept in a dataset or not. The issue is that,0
``CondensedNearestNeighbour`` is sensitive to noise by preserving the noisy,0
samples. ``OneSidedSelection`` also used the 1-NN and use ``TomekLinks`` to,0
remove the samples considered noisy. The ``NeighbourhoodCleaningRule`` use a,0
"``EditedNearestNeighbours`` to remove some sample. Additionally, they use a 3",0
nearest-neighbors to remove samples which do not agree with this rule.,0

``InstanceHardnessThreshold`` uses the prediction of classifier to exclude,0
samples. All samples which are classified with a low probability will be,0
removed.,0

Setting the data set,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
We use a part of the 20 newsgroups data set by loading 4 topics. Using the,0
"scikit-learn loader, the data are split into a training and a testing set.",0
,0
Note the class \#3 is the minority class and has almost twice less samples,0
than the majority class.,0
##############################################################################,0
The usual scikit-learn pipeline,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
You might usually use scikit-learn pipeline by combining the TF-IDF,0
vectorizer to feed a multinomial naive bayes classifier. A classification,0
report summarized the results on the testing set.,0
,0
"As expected, the recall of the class \#3 is low mainly due to the class",0
imbalanced.,0
##############################################################################,0
Balancing the class before classification,0
##############################################################################,0
##############################################################################,0
"To improve the prediction of the class \#3, it could be interesting to apply",0
"a balancing before to train the naive bayes classifier. Therefore, we will",0
use a ``RandomUnderSampler`` to equalize the number of samples in all the,0
classes before the training.,0
,0
It is also important to note that we are using the ``make_pipeline`` function,0
implemented in imbalanced-learn to properly handle the samplers.,0
##############################################################################,0
"Although the results are almost identical, it can be seen that the resampling",0
allowed to correct the poor recall of the class \#3 at the cost of reducing,0
"the other metrics for the other classes. However, the overall results are",0
slightly better.,0

The SVM smote model fits a support vector machine,0
classifier to the data and uses the support vector to,0
"provide a notion of boundary. Unlike regular smote, where",0
such notion relies on proportion of nearest neighbours,0

Reset the k-neighbours to m+1 neighbours,0
--- NN object,0
Import the NN object from scikit-learn library. Since in the smote,0
"variations we must first find samples that are in danger, we",0
initialize the NN object differently depending on the method chosen,0
"Regular smote does not look for samples in danger, instead it",0
creates synthetic samples directly from the k-th nearest,0
neighbours with not filtering,0
"Borderline1, 2 and SVM variations of smote must first look for",0
samples that could be considered noise and samples that live,0
"near the boundary between the classes. Therefore, before",0
"creating synthetic samples from the k-th nns, it first look",0
for m nearest neighbors to decide whether or not a sample is,0
noise or near the boundary.,0
--- SVM smote,0
"Unlike the borderline variations, the SVM variation uses the support",0
vectors to decide which samples are in danger (near the boundary).,0
Additionally it also introduces extrapolation for samples that are,0
considered safe (far from boundary) and interpolation for samples,0
in danger (near the boundary). The level of extrapolation is,0
controled by the out_step.,0

Import the NN object from scikit-learn library. Since in the smote,0
"variations we must first find samples that are in danger, we",0
initialize the NN object differently depending on the method chosen,0
"Regular smote does not look for samples in danger, instead it",0
creates synthetic samples directly from the k-th nearest,0
neighbours with not filtering,0
"Borderline1, 2 and SVM variations of smote must first look for",0
samples that could be considered noise and samples that live,0
"near the boundary between the classes. Therefore, before",0
"creating synthetic samples from the k-th nns, it first look",0
for m nearest neighbors to decide whether or not a sample is,0
noise or near the boundary.,0
--- SVM smote,0
"Unlike the borderline variations, the SVM variation uses the support",0
vectors to decide which samples are in danger (near the boundary).,0
Additionally it also introduces extrapolation for samples that are,0
considered safe (far from boundary) and interpolation for samples,0
in danger (near the boundary). The level of extrapolation is,0
controled by the out_step.,0

creates synthetic samples directly from the k-th nearest,0

samples that could be considered noise and samples that live,0
"near the boundary between the classes. Therefore, before",0
"creating synthetic samples from the k-th nns, it first look",0
for m nearest neighbors to decide whether or not a sample is,0
noise or near the boundary.,0
--- SVM smote,0
"Unlike the borderline variations, the SVM variation uses the support",0
vectors to decide which samples are in danger (near the boundary).,0
Additionally it also introduces extrapolation for samples that are,0

The SVM smote model fits a support vector machine,0
classifier to the data and uses the support vector to,0
"provide a notion of boundary. Unlike regular smote, where",0
such notion relies on proportion of nearest neighbours,0
belonging to each class.,0
Fit SVM to the full data#,0
Find the support vectors and their corresponding indexes,0
"First, find the nn of all the samples to identify samples",0
in danger and noisy ones,0

Reset the k-neighbours to m+1 neighbours,0
--- NN object,0
Import the NN object from scikit-learn library. Since in the smote,0
"variations we must first find samples that are in danger, we",0
initialize the NN object differently depending on the method chosen,0
"Regular smote does not look for samples in danger, instead it",0
creates synthetic samples directly from the k-th nearest,0
neighbours with not filtering,0
"Borderline1, 2 and SVM variations of smote must first look for",0
samples that could be considered noise and samples that live,0
"near the boundary between the classes. Therefore, before",0
"creating synthetic samples from the k-th nns, it first look",0
for m nearest neighbors to decide whether or not a sample is,0
noise or near the boundary.,0
--- SVM smote,0
"Unlike the borderline variations, the SVM variation uses the support",0
vectors to decide which samples are in danger (near the boundary).,0
Additionally it also introduces extrapolation for samples that are,0
considered safe (far from boundary) and interpolation for samples,0
in danger (near the boundary). The level of extrapolation is,0
controled by the out_step.,0

neighbours with not filtering,0
"Borderline1, 2 and SVM variations of smote must first look for",0
samples that could be considered noise and samples that live,0
"near the boundary between the classes. Therefore, before",0
"creating synthetic samples from the k-th nns, it first look",0
for m nearest neighbors to decide whether or not a sample is,0
noise or near the boundary.,0
--- SVM smote,0
"Unlike the borderline variations, the SVM variation uses the support",0
vectors to decide which samples are in danger (near the boundary).,0
Additionally it also introduces extrapolation for samples that are,0
considered safe (far from boundary) and interpolation for samples,0
in danger (near the boundary). The level of extrapolation is,0
controled by the out_step.,0

Create synthetic samples for borderline points.,0
Concatenate the newly generated samples to the original,0
dataset,0
Reset the k-neighbours to m+1 neighbours,0
Split the number of synthetic samples between only minority,0
"(type 1), or minority and majority (with reduced step size)",0
(type 2).,0

The SVM smote model fits a support vector machine,0
classifier to the data and uses the support vector to,0
"provide a notion of boundary. Unlike regular smote, where",0
such notion relies on proportion of nearest neighbours,0
belonging to each class.,0

Reset the k-neighbours to m+1 neighbours,0
--- NN object,0
Import the NN object from scikit-learn library. Since in the smote,0
"variations we must first find samples that are in danger, we",0
initialize the NN object differently depending on the method chosen,0
"Regular smote does not look for samples in danger, instead it",0
creates synthetic samples directly from the k-th nearest,0
neighbours with not filtering,0
"Borderline1, 2 and SVM variations of smote must first look for",0
samples that could be considered noise and samples that live,0
"near the boundary between the classes. Therefore, before",0
"creating synthetic samples from the k-th nns, it first look",0
for m nearest neighbors to decide whether or not a sample is,0
noise or near the boundary.,0
--- SVM smote,0
"Unlike the borderline variations, the SVM variation uses the support",0
vectors to decide which samples are in danger (near the boundary).,0
Additionally it also introduces extrapolation for samples that are,0
considered safe (far from boundary) and interpolation for samples,0
in danger (near the boundary). The level of extrapolation is,0
controled by the out_step.,0

--- Generating synthetic samples,0
Use static method make_samples to generate minority samples,0
Concatenate the newly generated samples to the original data set,0
Find the NNs for all samples in the data set.,0
Boolean array with True for minority samples in danger,0
"If all minority samples are safe, return the original data set.",0
"All are safe, nothing to be done here.",0
"If we got here is because some samples are in danger, we need to",0
find the NNs among the minority class to create the new synthetic,0
samples.,0
,0
We start by changing the number of NNs to consider from m + 1,0
to k + 1,0
nns...#,0
B1 and B2 types diverge here!!!,0
Create synthetic samples for borderline points.,0
Concatenate the newly generated samples to the original,0
dataset,0
Reset the k-neighbours to m+1 neighbours,0
Split the number of synthetic samples between only minority,0
"(type 1), or minority and majority (with reduced step size)",0
(type 2).,0
The fraction is sampled from a beta distribution centered,0
around 0.5 with variance ~0.01,0
Only minority,0
Only majority with smaller step size,0
Concatenate the newly generated samples to the original,0
data set,0
Reset the k-neighbours to m+1 neighbours,0
The SVM smote model fits a support vector machine,0
classifier to the data and uses the support vector to,0
"provide a notion of boundary. Unlike regular smote, where",0
such notion relies on proportion of nearest neighbours,0
belonging to each class.,0
Fit SVM to the full data#,0
Find the support vectors and their corresponding indexes,0
"First, find the nn of all the samples to identify samples",0
in danger and noisy ones,0
"As usual, fit a nearest neighbour model to the data",0
"Now, get rid of noisy support vectors",0
Remove noisy support vectors,0
Proceed to find support vectors NNs among the minority class,0
Split the number of synthetic samples between interpolation and,0
extrapolation,0
The fraction are sampled from a beta distribution with mean,0
0.5 and variance 0.01#,0
Interpolate samples in danger,0
Extrapolate safe samples,0
Concatenate the newly generated samples to the original data set,0
not any support vectors in danger,0
All the support vector in danger,0
Reset the k-neighbours to m+1 neighbours,0
--- NN object,0
Import the NN object from scikit-learn library. Since in the smote,0
"variations we must first find samples that are in danger, we",0
initialize the NN object differently depending on the method chosen,0
"Regular smote does not look for samples in danger, instead it",0
creates synthetic samples directly from the k-th nearest,0
neighbours with not filtering,0
"Borderline1, 2 and SVM variations of smote must first look for",0
samples that could be considered noise and samples that live,0
"near the boundary between the classes. Therefore, before",0
"creating synthetic samples from the k-th nns, it first look",0
for m nearest neighbors to decide whether or not a sample is,0
noise or near the boundary.,0
--- SVM smote,0
"Unlike the borderline variations, the SVM variation uses the support",0
vectors to decide which samples are in danger (near the boundary).,0
Additionally it also introduces extrapolation for samples that are,0
considered safe (far from boundary) and interpolation for samples,0
in danger (near the boundary). The level of extrapolation is,0
controled by the out_step.,0

--- NN object,0
Import the NN object from scikit-learn library. Since in the smote,0
"variations we must first find samples that are in danger, we",0
initialize the NN object differently depending on the method chosen,0
"Regular smote does not look for samples in danger, instead it",0
creates synthetic samples directly from the k-th nearest,0
neighbours with not filtering,0
"Borderline1, 2 and SVM variations of smote must first look for",0
samples that could be considered noise and samples that live,0
"near the boundary between the classes. Therefore, before",0
"creating synthetic samples from the k-th nns, it first look",0
for m nearest neighbors to decide whether or not a sample is,0
noise or near the boundary.,0
--- SVM smote,0
"Unlike the borderline variations, the SVM variation uses the support",0
vectors to decide which samples are in danger (near the boundary).,0
Additionally it also introduces extrapolation for samples that are,0
considered safe (far from boundary) and interpolation for samples,0
in danger (near the boundary). The level of extrapolation is,0
controled by the out_step.,0

Split the number of synthetic samples between only minority,0
"(type 1), or minority and majority (with reduced step size)",0
(type 2).,0
The fraction is sampled from a beta distribution centered,0

The SVM smote model fits a support vector machine,0
classifier to the data and uses the support vector to,0
"provide a notion of boundary. Unlike regular smote, where",0
such notion relies on proportion of nearest neighbours,0
belonging to each class.,0
Fit SVM to the full data#,0
Find the support vectors and their corresponding indexes,0
"First, find the nn of all the samples to identify samples",0
in danger and noisy ones,0

Reset the k-neighbours to m+1 neighbours,0
--- NN object,0
Import the NN object from scikit-learn library. Since in the smote,0
"variations we must first find samples that are in danger, we",0
initialize the NN object differently depending on the method chosen,0
"Regular smote does not look for samples in danger, instead it",0
creates synthetic samples directly from the k-th nearest,0
neighbours with not filtering,0
"Borderline1, 2 and SVM variations of smote must first look for",0
samples that could be considered noise and samples that live,0
"near the boundary between the classes. Therefore, before",0
"creating synthetic samples from the k-th nns, it first look",0
for m nearest neighbors to decide whether or not a sample is,0
noise or near the boundary.,0
--- SVM smote,0
"Unlike the borderline variations, the SVM variation uses the support",0
vectors to decide which samples are in danger (near the boundary).,0
Additionally it also introduces extrapolation for samples that are,0
considered safe (far from boundary) and interpolation for samples,0
in danger (near the boundary). The level of extrapolation is,0
controled by the out_step.,0

--- NN object,0
Import the NN object from scikit-learn library. Since in the smote,0
"variations we must first find samples that are in danger, we",0
initialize the NN object differently depending on the method chosen,0
"Regular smote does not look for samples in danger, instead it",0
creates synthetic samples directly from the k-th nearest,0
neighbours with not filtering,0
"Borderline1, 2 and SVM variations of smote must first look for",0
samples that could be considered noise and samples that live,0
"near the boundary between the classes. Therefore, before",0
"creating synthetic samples from the k-th nns, it first look",0
for m nearest neighbors to decide whether or not a sample is,0
noise or near the boundary.,0
--- SVM smote,0
"Unlike the borderline variations, the SVM variation uses the support",0
vectors to decide which samples are in danger (near the boundary).,0
Additionally it also introduces extrapolation for samples that are,0
considered safe (far from boundary) and interpolation for samples,0
in danger (near the boundary). The level of extrapolation is,0
controled by the out_step.,0
